This iPhone came in almost-new condition. It also came with its own changer, which was a plus. However, the battery health was at 80%. After a month worth of use, it is down to 76%. While I am careful to charge the battery and disconnect it as soon as it reaches 100% charge, still, the battery health for an iPhone 6S cannot be expected to be any higher, considering the years of use any pre-owned phone might have had. A good suggestion might be to replace the old battery with a new one. Definitely, seller is not to be blamed for battery's condition.


After few years of use I don’t feel the phone is worth it. Battery dies much quicker and OS is slow. Apple is asking me to pay full replacement price for service. I guess I’m going to buy new iPhone 12 when it’s out.
