Dropped the thing several times on carpet from waist height, once on cement, and no hints of any issues or defects and the case holds up well to impacts.The downsides:It can be a bit tiresome to take your phone out.You'll want to take your phone out as there's an opening in the back and dirt/dust will get in necessitating cleaning of your phone and the case itself.The plastic film/cover is difficult to clean around the edges, if you're OCD about this kind of thing than I'd suggest another case.The aforementioned plastic also has a tendency to develop a faint oil-slick distortion, it isn't significant but definitely noticeable.The soft silicone covering is probably the weak link here in that it's easy to tear accidentally when you're removing your phone from the case; despite my best efforts about six months in I accidentally tore a small edge which enlarged over time.It didn't bother me at the time but now that I'm back to using a smaller case, the size of the OtterBox is something to be aware of, really it's just huge.",2.0,Decent protection sub par everything else,1398643200,"04 28, 2014"

Even the Apple logo is covered by a clear protective film.2. Has a built-in belt clip.  It rotates a full 360 degrees, clicking and locking at 15 degree steps (24 different angles).3. Has a rubber covering over the bottom docking connector, top audio jack, top &#34;sleep&#34; button, side volume buttons, front &#34;home&#34; button, and side &#34;silent&#34; switch.4. Has a built-in screen protection film so you aren't actually touching the iPhone screen.5. If you want, you can reverse the snap-in piece and put the case together so the screen is facing &#34;out&#34; and visible.  If you rotate the belt clip 180 degrees, you could then clip it onto your belt with the screen out.

My main objective in purchasing a case was the best protection possible for my phone. I am not disappointed.This Defender series Otterbox is basically three pieces - a two-piece hard plastic case and a thick, silicone skin which covers the plastic case. A clear plastic membrane is integrated into the hard plastic case which covers your entire screen. There is also a hard plastic holster with a ratcheting clip for wearing your phone on your hip.I took off a star for the poor directions on how to put your phone into the case. (Because of the 3 pieces and the perfect fit, it is a little complicated getting it apart, installing the phone and then getting it back together.) There is no insert or directions in the box. Only when you remove the Otterbox from the packaging do you see a few illustrations (which are very small and not nearly detailed enough) on how to use this case. I searched YouTube and found several videos that showed plainly how to do it and I would suggest others do the same if they haven't used an Otterbox before. I am mystified as to why Otterbox would make such an excellent product and then neglect to include better directions for installing your phone in the case.The fit is perfect and the silicone which covers the buttons is soft and flexible so it doesn't impair using the buttons. The clear membrane doesn't affect the responsiveness of the touch screen. The hard plastic case features a lip which is raised up from the screen so your phone will be safe if you drop it face down. The back of the case is covered in textured silicone which helps you grip your phone. Really, it's like Fort Knox  for your 4S!Be aware that for this level of protection, you sacrifice the sleekness of your phone. This case adds substantial bulk and gives it a clunkier look and feel. The holster is REALLY bulky, too. If that will ruin the iPhone experience for you, I would look at the Otterbox Commuter series.

With my job my phone has a rough ride so I decided on another Otterbox Defender case, but heard about the iPhone 4S case, so I went with that.Holy smokes, this is the case Otterbox should have made the first time around.

I dont expect this case's rubber cover to sag out or pop up like the previous model.  The rubber also has a better texture and doesnt seem as grippy so it doesnt try to barricade up in your pocket.The camera port and the front sensor port are way larger now also.  So far its way easier to clear the ports with a finger or a kleenex, and gone are the days of being screwed until you find a Q-tip.Hopefully this should elimiate some of the issues of the phones sensor being ""jammed"" and the touch screen turning on while on your face, causing calls to be out on mute or hold.So far, this case is hands down above the others.

My requirement for buying a phone that could be considered &#34;excessive&#34; for an 11 year old was that she MUST keep it on her phone at all times.  Let me tell you, it has saved the day on numerous occasions!  I hear her phone &#34;thud&#34; about once a week in our house; so far there has been NO damage whatsoever.  She also accidentally dropped it into the bathtub (don't ask!) and while this case isn't positioned as &#34;waterproof&#34;, it still has enough water resistance that it kept her phone dry after a quick dunk.  All-in-all, a great case.  My ONLY complaint is that after about 10 months of use, the soft rubbery outside case has stretched out and has become floppy, and the port covers didn't fit any more.

Mccaffrey ""Matt OneLANE""","[0, 0]","I've owned my iPhone 4s for over two years, and am currently on my secondOtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 4/4S - Frustration-Free Packaging - Purple/White. The Defender, being reviewed here, is a different approach to the same problem of protecting a slab of aluminum with two glass faces.The Defender series shares with the Commuter the same basic elements of silicone rubber and a very hard plastic shell--one sandwiching the other. While the Commuter puts the rubber inside, surrounding the phone, the Defender takes the opposite approach. A two-piece polycarbonate plastic shell encloses the iPhone, and the shell is closed with three snap-tabs. The face includes a clear conductive shield for the touchscreen; the shield is welded to the shell. The back has a very thin foam cushion with ""Otter BOX"" embossed, and ports for camera/flash and the Apple logo. The latter also has a conductive shield over it, presumably so the shiny Apple logo does not get smudged.With the sandwich snapped together, you'll notice the main buttons are a bit less accessible. The outer, silicone rubber case addresses this by including molded-in nubs that reach the Home, power, and volume buttons. The only control that cannot receive this treatment is the mute switch, which instead is reached directly by opening a flap on the case. Manipulating the mute switch is difficult, because it is surrounded by a &#8539;-inch thick layer of plastic and rubber, and the open flap must be held open. Other controls work very, very easily.Once encased, the iPhone is very well protected from shock and some liquid assaults. The reset hole is always accessible, and the headphone port flap allows for right-angle headphone plugs to be used. The earpiece/front camera port is always open. The screen surround is slightly beveled, which makes it a little easier to thumb-type than with the Commuter (which seems to push the thumb away from spots near the edges of the screen). The speaker ports are always exposed. The universal port is protected by a large flap, which when open leaves plenty of room for a plug. All flaps are hinged at the front. This may allow for easier docking, though I do not have a dock with which to test this.The built-in screen protector works well, with just enough friction for the user to maintain control over gestures. I did notice a slight gap between protector and screen, just enough to be annoying.I only tested the holster briefly. The encased iPhone snaps in, and may face either face-in or face-out. The holster actually locks the phone in, using a tab on the holster to match one of the two side tabs on the plastic shell. The clip rotates 360, allowing the user to carry the phone in any orientation and to place the lock-tab wherever it is handiest.The Defender case is well-named. When encased and holstered, the iPhone sports three layers of protection--silicone rubber sandwiched between two layers of polycarbonate. Of course, I'll allow someone else to do drop and contamination tests--that's why my iPhone is still working well after two years!Despite that, I'll keep using my Commuter for this purpose. The Defender case, sans holster, will slip into a pocket, which is how I carry my iPhone. But, the case makes the phone nearly a -inch thicker, not to mention a -inch wider and taller. The Commuter is a lightweight alternative that works well for me.If your needs are for heavier protection--such as when working construction or maintenance--the Defender is the better choice.",5.0,"Solid, solid protection for your iPhone 4/4s",1390176000,"01 20, 2014"

Describing the screen protector as fitting &#34;flush and flat on the screen&#34; is dishonest at best.  There is a fair bit of space between the screen protector and the screen itself which has resulted in a very noticeable decrease in touch sensitivity.If you use your phone mostly for texting and facebook this probably won't be a big deal - you'll just have to get used to poking quite a bit harder and occasionally having to hit buttons more than once to get the hit to register.  However if you use your iphone to game it will be difficult to justify the increased weight and dramatic loss of touch sensitivity (particularly noticeable for swipe/slash motions, these aren't registering half the time even if I push fairly hard.)I've decided to downgrade to a case with less protection that doesn't have such a negative impact on the phone's functionality.

I generally take very good care of my belongings but I do suffer the occasional bout of clumsiness and have been known to drop my phone.  I have pretty much exclusively used iSkin cases in the past (with good results) for my previous iPhones but felt that my screen wasn't very well protected with the screen cover/film that they typically provide you with and that overall the cases could be a little sturdier.  After seeing some of my friends and co-workers that had similar Otterbox cases for their phones I finally decided to take the plunge and give Otterbox a try.  Let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  The case is sturdy but doesn't add too much bulk to the phone and it has a great cover for the touch screen that doesn't seem flimsy like some of the screen covers/films I've been accustomed to in the past.  My only gripe about the case would be that the port covers did not completely close.  I actually had to take a craft knife and trim some of the excess plastic/rubber off two different port covers so they fit in place and closed all the way like they were supposed to.  Had it not been for this minor inconvenience I would have given it 5 stars.  Overall this a great case to protect your investment and at a good price to boot.  If you are concerned with how the color may look in person vs. online as some of the other reviewers have posted, I suggest taking a look at the cases at the nearest supplier to get an idea before you order online.

It has kept my iPhone 4S in perfect shape since it's been installed.  I've read some of the reviews here claiming some really bizarre stuff, like this case should protect you from a drop of 1 to 2 stories high, that's just crazy.  I'm 6'6"" and my phone has fallen from my hands a few times and landed on wood floors and concrete with no damage at all.Will it protect your phone from any fall?  No, the Apple iPhone 4S has glass on the front and the back, and if the phone lands just right with the right amount of force the glass can still break.  What this case will do is give you every possible chance that the phone won't break during normal use.One guy said it was hard to go from silent mode to ring mode because he had big hands, that seems impossible to me as I have bigger hands than anyone I know and it's very easy to make the switch.  Sure, you have to open the little rubber flap to access the switch, but that's super easy to do.I've seen reviews complaining of air bubbles between the screen and the case, I've never noticed any with my phone.  Maybe I got lucky and got a phone / case pair that fits together perfectly.  My father has the same phone and same case and I have never noticed an air bubble on his phone either.For me, I think this is the best case option.  The only con I can think of is that the case adds a fair amount of weight and size to the slim iPhone, but I actually prefer the feel with it in the case.  Again, I have big hands so your mileage may vary if you prefer your phones to feel as small and light as they can.Once I move on from the iPhone 4S, I'm sure my next phone will be protected by another Otterbox case.",5.0,Has Kept My Iphone 4S Like New For A Year,1349136000,"10 2, 2012"

We've found them to be quite durable. The time my phone slid off of my office chair to the floor I was not worried whatsoever (my iPod Nano, after a similar spill, had a shattered touch digitizer).My friend and I, after several months, have started experiencing the same issue. The silicone flap at the bottom of the phone has stretched/warped. This means that we can no longer get the flap to stay closed (we know how to close it, it just won't stay that way), and the whole bottom portion of the silicone cover is coming away from the harder plastic frame.  It's very frustrating. The case looks cheap and has lost the functionality of keeping stuff out. If this is a result of ""operator error"" it would only be because I made the error of thinking that the case would remain operational.I can't think of how to avoid the warping problem while still being able to charge the phone as needed.

The price difference made it tempting, but I'm glad I chose the Defender series for its comprehensive protection, including a screen protector.  I also like that it comes with a sturdy holster, which while I probably won't use, it's a nice addition.The instructions are simple, but I did view a 'how-to' video on the Amazon site prior to installing it, and after taking a quick look at the enclosed picture directions.Installation of the case is easy and quick.  The case arrives as it will be installed.  You peel off the silicone outer shell, to expose a hard case with the screen protector as part of it.  Three snaps (two on the sides and one on the top) open the inner case.  You place your iPhone back side to the Otterbox padded logo).  I suggest placing the bottom in first, as it seemed to work best for me.Place the top of the inner cover on the phone and match up the holes with the Home button and receiver (earpiece).  Snap the three snaps together to enclose the phone and then you're ready for the outer silicone layer.The outer layer went on easily, but I worked again from the bottom of the phone, making sure I adjusted around the ports.  I noted some puckering along the edges initially, but found that if I seated the silicone properly around the snaps, the case fit perfectly.Ports are easy to access, as are buttons.  Some effort will have to be made to get to certain things, but hey, it's that way with most any case. Speakers are unaffected by this case.The Home button and volume buttons work fine, as does the on/off.  The screen protector doesn't affect the multi-touch display in any way for me, which makes me very happy.I was a bit hesitant to order this case as I thought it would be too bulky, and yet I wanted as much protection for my iPhone as possible.

It completely broke off on mine and my wifes if cracked which will eventually break off too.3. when the clip was in tact it would often times get snagged on my shirt or hip when attatched to my belt leaving it in an open position which made the phone vunerable to coming off the belt.4. the rubber flap on the bottom of the phone that covers the port connection is tearing away.

I found this peony pink and gunmetal grey case and ordered it. My phone came in within 4 days, a lot earlier than expected. I was very careful in handling it and didn't dare take it out of the house -- I was NOT going to get any scratches or cracks on my phone in its first days like a lot of my friends have. When my OtterBox arrived, I opened it, and to my great surprise, it had both logo protection AND a built-in plastic screen protector! It snapped on pretty easily, but the gunmetal grey layer (silicone, I believe?) was a bit difficult to remove from the pink plastic layer at first. It's a great case and I have no regrets whatsoever about my purchase. So just stop, your search ends here. GET THIS CASE.My only negative comment is that the screen protector is a bit thick and makes the screen slightly grainy, but I'll take this over the difficult manual installation of a screen protector any day!Oh, and to all of you people out there who are complaining about how the OtterBox triples the size of the phone: the OtterBox is a case made for protection, not to show off the iPhone's tiny size.EDIT: After a few months of use, I do have some negative things to say.1. The screen protector has gotten cracked/scratched. I honestly don't know how, as I've only dropped my phone 3 times and have checked it for any visible damage, and there was none.2. The USB port silicone cover refuses to close. I've had a lot of people try to get it to fit on there, but it won't.3. Dirt, dust, hair -- you name it, it's gotten trapped in the case!

7685,1135164,A12GLRXAC7FMXH,B005SUHPO6,J. B.,"[0, 0]","The Otterbox Defender is a huge case. It doubles the thickness of your iPhone 4s, gives it a grippy non-slip silicone surface, making it feel gigantic. Huge enough that I can't really put it in my front jeans pocket, and practically have to use the provided belt clip. It causes a noticeable telling bulge in any pocket I put my phone in, and the silicone case means the phone practically pulls the pocket inside out when trying to get my phone out from there.This case will protect your iPhone against most things around the house and office. For most people it is going to work exceptionally well and exceed their needs. It is tough enough to survive urban environments and hard abusers of delicate electronic equipment. I'm happy with the Defender case, it works well.But, where I get worried about the case is the outdoors.There are four major openings on the case. Two do not seal fully, and the other two don't provide much more than simple dirt protection to the port. The fourth, the camera hole opening, doesn't seal, and leaves a fair amount of the lens easily reached. While this has the advantage of keeping the iPhone's excellent camera and white LED uncovered for quick photos, it also leaves it exposed to dust, gunk, and crap that will inevitably settle there. There is no good way to clean it out, short of taking the case apart, cleaning the case and phone, then reassembling or breaking out cotton swabs and digging in. This case doesn't water seal at all (the packaging does say so), it will block errant splashes to the screen, but if liquid pools on the camera hole or speaker, it'll be wicked right under the protective plastic, sealing against the phone.The silicone body of the case does block most dust, sand, and such from getting in to the major holes of the phone though, and it is tough enough for most users. It just could be better, and would be if the textured back side didn't seem to hold on to every bit of dirt, dust, oil, cheese, etc it was set on, and were easier to clean while still on the plastic protector with the phone in place.",3.0,"Tough, but not Baer Grylls Tough.",1328054400,"02 1, 2012"

When I took the two pieces apart, the outside cover seemed very ""rubbery"", not the same durable feel as the one we just bought my son from the phone store.  I then took apart the hard plastic shell and noticed it did not have the ""Otterbox"" stamp imprinted on the foam back like my other one does.  I put my phone inside, snapped the shell back together and it didn't seem to close very well.  I also noticed that the clear plastic seemed to stick to the front of my phone creating bubbles on the front whenever I push on an icon.I guess I got duped and just assumed Amazon would not let a retailer sell fake merchandise.

The outer rubber shell seems to have either a manufacturing, materials, or inherent design problem that causes it to stretch and warp over time, seemingly even under light-to-normal daily use.Mind you, I'm not someone who abuses my phone... I work from home, I don't travel much, and I'm not constantly on my phone. The phone spends a lot of time sitting on my desk, in my pocket, or in the holster.After experiencing the warping problem the first time, where I was noticing gaps between the inner plastic frame and the outer rubber shell after about 4 months of use, I contacted Otterbox support. They requested photos detailing the problem, and once received, sent me a new retail-boxed replacement, no questions asked.The problem is, 6 months later, my replacement is starting to show the same problem as the orginal... bulging rubber, which is especially troublesome over the home button area. The dock port flap is also starting to tear along the lip that tucks under the plastic frame, so it will no longer stay closed.I still like the Otterbox Defender for all of it's positive qualities, but I shouldn't be forced to seek warranty replacement every 4-6 months because the product suffers from durability issues. It's great that Otterbox will replace it for me with little to no hassle, but it just shouldn't be necessary from a product that clearly has a great deal of attention to details in so many other areas of it's design.",3.0,"Very Protective, But Questionable Durability",1362182400,"03 2, 2013"

I had heard good things about otterbox so I shelled out the cash for one. I was very impressed with the product when I opened it! Inside of the rubber outer casing is a sturdy plastic case that actually holds your phone. I thought that the &#34;screen protector&#34; would be one of those stupid stickers that don't really do much of anything, but I was surprised to see it's actually a clear hard plastic that takes away any fear of scratching your screen. After you have your phone properly encased in the product you have a complete sense of insurance about your phone. The outer rubber case covers all of the buttons and ports very securely taking away the likelihood of getting dirt and grime in places that you don't want it. The charging port for example is covered by the rubber, however it easily opens for charging/ syncing purposes. The other buttons maintain full functionality while being covered and have the same ease of use! I work for a shipping company where life is rough for phones, constantly being dropped, dirty, and getting banged around in your pocket. I have no fear of any damage happening period to it! If I had to say anything bad about it, it would simply be that it is fairly bulky, but I'll take a bulky phone over a broken phone any day!",5.0,Great Protection,1379376000,"09 17, 2013"

The inner looks like average plastic that's strong but not brittle. You also have a built-in screen protector. The real issue is the rubber sleeve. They have very poor quality control and the port covers are super annoying. First off, it's hard to get the rubber flush on the plastic inner case because you have to slide parts under the plastic tabs but the holes weren't cut the same and you need to squish it around a bunch.The charger flap is basically never closed on my case. If you open it you will need 15 seconds and 4 tries to get the damn flap tucked in and secure, and if you run your finger along it the thing will pop out again. I know a few people with this case who cut the flap off.The headphone port is okay but I would rather not have another mediocre flap covering up only the headphone jack while leaving a hole for the microphone. It's not blocking very much and I use headphones all the time and have to deal with another annoying dangling rubber thing.An aesthetic issue is that viewport for the apple logo on the back. It probably makes the case less secure and it's pretty obvious the phone is an iphone anyways, I don't want an obnoxious window advertising my phone everywhere. Also makes it more likely to get stolen if you're traveling because of the world's fascination with apply products.The final issue is durability. I noticed a friends' defender case that they had for 6 months and it looked like garbage. The annoying rubber was no longer flush with the undercase, in fact it was deformed and stretched to such a degree it looked like it would slip off. The home button was hard to press because it wouldn't line up anymore, the charger flap was literally impossible to close, and pocket lint and more could find its merry way under the screen cover. The case is pretty big and almost doubles the thickness of an iphone, so it's not likely to fit in most pockets without struggles. My friend still said the case saved her phone from a few drops and being on surfaces, so there was some practicality.Overall, this case is okay. It will totally increase the life of your phone if you are prone to dropping, spinning, fidgeting, etc. However, it's clearly made at low cost with poor control for specifications, which leads to a number of moderate annoyances. It might not age well either. Also has stupid apple logo window that will make you a target when travelling.",3.0,Strong but sloppy,1343088000,"07 24, 2012"

Unfortunately, I've not come across the 'perfect' one yet. As for the Otter Defender, it definitely provides great protection at a reasonable price. The belt clip that comes with it is sturdy and has remained firmly in place, no matter how much movement I make or what position I find myself in. It also serves as a nice 'hand holder' for the iPhone, in addition to serving as a stand. The belt clip can be attached horizontally or vertically, so it really is quite versatile.As for the 'down' aspects - the worst is, by far, the screen. There is a screen protector included as part of the case, but it attracts and holds fingerprints and body oils like glue.....and nothing seems to clean them off. The soft cloth that makes the original display perfect in seconds, just smears on this screen protector. I've tried eye glass cleaner and the dish soap and water that the manufacturer recommended, but the screen just always looked dirty. Finally, I did what several other reviewers did - took off the screen protector, so that the beautiful glass retina display is back! And fingerprints once again come off easily to make the screen look new and beautiful again. The downside is that the screen is no longer AS protected from scratches, but the rest of the case still makes it impact resistant - which is primarily what I wanted it for in the first place. And, when using the belt clip, putting the phone in with the screen facing the inside of the clip case, provides plenty of protection for the screen.The only other thing to be aware of is that the case (and the clip) does make the phone a lot heavier. If you're wearing pants or shorts that are not tight around your waist, the weight of the phone and the clip will definitely make them sag!The camera and all buttons and ports work just fine with the case on.

I've dropped my phone on concrete floors many times, and nothing broke or scratched. It does add some bulk to the phone, but that is to be expected, and a small price to pay for the level of protection it affords.Now the cons.1) It is a pain to take on and off. Not a big deal, because I seldom remove it from this case, but still worth mentioning. I also feel that this falls under the category of small price to pay for the protection level you get.2) The opening at the bottom for the connector cable is only big enough for Apple charging cables. If you buy a third party cable that is any thicker, you wont be able to use it. Again, I don't see this as a deal breaker, just something to consider.3) The one real PITA about this case is that the opening for the camera lens is small, and when you use the flash in low light situations, it reflects back into the lens and washes out your photo. This doesn't affect pictures taken in good light without the flash, only the ones in low light with the flash. It took me a long time to realize it was my case, not the quality of the camera in my iPhone. Now when I want to take a pic in low light, I remove the iPhone from the case, which brings me back to complaint number 1.This would be a perfect case if Otterbox would make the camera hole bigger, but that's my only real complaint.

We have owned these cases for 4 months now, and my husband loves his black OtterBox case...it is sturdy, the screen protector fits and works well (non-glare), the fit was (and remains) great. My Pink/Gunmetal Grey case, however, is another story. While I loved the colors (it looks just as pictured online), within one month the grey silicone outer cover began to pull away from the hard inner (pink)case on the sides, and now will NOT ""stay put"", no matter how many times I reposition it. It really looks terrible...the flap over the charging end is actually floppy and just sticks out all the time.

The only reason hers got replaced, she wanted a new color combination.

I haven't had any serious &#34;drops&#34; but I'm not as worried about protecting my phone anymore.Sure, the Defender does add quite a bit of bulk to the ever-sleek iPhone, and the rubbery texture would make it difficult to easily slide in and out of pockets.

I'm sure there are some people in this world that need to use such a case to protect their phone, but I am not one of those.  My last phone died a horrible death because I tossed it into my cupholder in the car, which was not a smart move at all, and as a result, the display cracked.  After that, I was pressued into getting a case that would prevent such an occurance from happenning again.  I'm positive that the Defender case would have protected my last phone from me, but for my every day use, this case is just too much.To start, it would've been nice if there had been some instructions (or the pictures on the box were a bit easier to see), but I figured out how to get the case open and put my phone inside.  It just seemed as if the case was too bulky, and I discovered that I wouldn't be able to put the phone on my alarm clock/charger since the case would not allow the phone to sit all the way down on the connector.  When I purchased the phone, I did buy an InCase cover for the phone, and I now feel that it would be more than enough to protect the phone from my everyday usage.  The Defender will get returned, and someone who really needs some serious protection can have it.

8696,1136175,AB2XOOC437I26,B005SUHPO6,Johnny V,"[332, 363]","First of all, if you want to protect your iPhone, this is a terrific case.  If you want sleek and flashy, keep looking.  Don't get me wrong, I like the way the phone looks with the Otterbox on it but there just are not any sequins or monograms.This is really two cases in one, or, a case with a rubberized cover.  When you open the package, you will notice a plastic ""clam shell"" case that you snap over the phone.  The second part of the case is the rubberized cover which wraps around the phone.  The negative BUT NECESSARY results about this case is that it will double the thickness of the phone and make it heavier.  This case includes a shield that protects the screen so no need to buy those expensive screen protectors.  The only exposed area of the phone are the holes for the speakers, microphones, and camera lens.When I first put the case together, I thought the same as the previous reviewer that the earphone jack hole was in the wrong place.  That assumption is incorrect.  The hole on the top of the phone is for the secondary, noise-cancelling, built in microphone.  The earphone jack is intended to be covered when not in use in order to keep dirt from getting into the hole for the jack.  Just like the power cord and mute switch, the flap has to be opened in order to plug the earphones in.  Speaking of flaps, they are a necessary evil when it comes to total protection.  Putting them back in place requires a bit of patience but it is not a big deal.All of the functions of this case are protected.  Each button, the volume, power, and control button are under the cover.  The screen is also under a protective rubber shield.  I was concerned that the interface would be hindered but everything works well even with the added layer between my hand and the screen/buttons.  The buttons are quite responsive and the screen taps, scrolls, etc, seem to work just as well as they did before I installed the case.A huge bonus about this case is how my telephone reception IMPROVED.  Getting my first iPhone was becoming a very frustrating experience due to a very high amount of dropped calls.  For some reason, getting that barrier between my hand and the phone itself has dramatically improved my reception resulting in virtually no dropped calls.  I definitely like the feel of my phone much better with the case than I did with no protection at all.Lastly, you may be surprised to find that this case may change the appearance of the color of your phone.  My phone is black but the plastic case is white.  From the front and side views, you would think my phone is white.  It is not until you look at the back side of the phone that the black shows through the hole for the apple logo.The only thing I do not use or particularly care for is the holster that comes with the phone.  I am using a leather pouch and prefer it instead of the snappy, hard holster.  (Just a preference, not a knock)  I recommend you look at the Otterbox at a retail store like AT&T; before you buy it sight unseen from Amazon.  The store I viewed them at was selling them for $50 and I purchased mine on Amazon for $32.60.Good luck!",5.0,Works Great With iPhone 4S,1321488000,"11 17, 2011"

I'm not exceptionally rough with my phone, but no phone case will hold up to the standard stresses dished out by the average college student.

I use the holster/stand on my nightstand and it works beautifully as an alarm clock stand.

When I originally bought my iPhone 4S, I had a very hard plastic case. Not sure how it happened, but I got out of my car and my phone landed on the driveway after falling some distance on the concrete and died in several pieces. Fortunately, I had a warranty that covered a total replacement.I've been using a Spiegen case since then and have been happy with it. However, I wish it had more padding to cushion my phone from possible damage.I received this today  in the mail. While this case is on the bulkier side this is no issue for me. It provides absolutely great coverage, is engineered to accomodate the cutouts, and is made of a very flexible silicon that can accomodate the cords needed for charging. In fact, I am charging it right now. Additionally, the case has a nice holster that works well with the belt I usually wear with my jeans.I never really got the passion or price for the OtterBox case until I looked this over. It is so well padded and offers so much coverage that this should protect an iPhone from most disasters that involve breakage, splintering and cracking, and the dreaded scratches.If you are worried about keeping the phone and Suri safe, this is decidedly a good option if you aren't put off by bulk.",4.0,I Finally Get It,1390521600,"01 24, 2014"

Not so good.This is my first experience with an Otterbox case, and unless you are a very careless person, there are many less bulky protective cases out there that maintain the sleek look of an iPhone.One of the features I do like, is the protective screen: it is clear! and I was amazed at how well the touch screen worked despite the thickness of the lens.The holster snap case is really plasticky (i.e. CHEAP!)...

I drop my phone a lot, and thus far have not had to buy a new phone due to cracks or shock damage. However, I have gone through several cases because the wear and tear the case will inevitably endure is too much for the soft rubber and cheap plastic. This, my friends, may be why they put extensive limitations on the so-called one-year warranty.This brand was innovated in 1998 as an actual waterproof box the ""klutzy"" technology owners could put their device into. Now, there are several lines of cases that are form fitting to that specific piece of technology. There are six different series that range from a one hundred percent waterproof box to a screen protector with a silicone outer-layer. I own the Defender series that comes with a screen protector, polycarbonate inner layer, and a silicone outer layer. From what I've observed, people that own an OtterBox case use this series, which in most stores costs about forty dollars.This case is better than the majority of protective covers sold on the market as far as coverage and protection goes, but it still has its flaws. The creator may have named the product after the waterproof fur that an otter possesses, but this cover is not completely waterproof. I spilled some of a drink on top of my phone, and liquid bubbles somehow leaked underneath the screen protector. I realize this problem can be cleaned out like it never happened so I won't dwell on the occasional water bubble. My important request is that they design the outer silicone layer to be a little stronger so it doesn't rip or stretch out.Additionally, I learned from personal experience that the screen protector can get scratched by: keys, small rocks, nails, and any other point object your phone may come in contact with. I also want to give you owners or potential buyers a piece of advice, if your device is attached to your hand like its glued on permanently make sure you clean the case regularly. Between all the different layers there are small nooks and crannies that can contain more germs, dust, and dirt than you can imagine.If you do like this case but are looking for something a bit more extreme, the LifeProof case might strike your fancy. For about twenty bucks more you will have a lifetime-guaranteed shock proof and waterproof case that can go up to fifteen feet underwater. I have heard nothing but amazing things about this product. Overall, the case will give its looks and life to save your phone and do its job with flying colors, literally. Despite a few issues that develop over a long period of time this case is a good investment. I will say hands down, the OtterBox case is worth the extra cash you will spend compared to Specks, ToughSkin, and Belkin. I have owned each of these cases and they do not compete.",4.0,Great case for the klutzy phone owner!,1346976000,"09 7, 2012"

I'm a moderately clumsy person (I don't usually trip over my own feet or up stairs, but I have a bad habit of dropping things, especially my phones), so I knew as soon as I made the decision to get an iPhone that I *had* to get a decent case for it. My old non-smart phone could take my beatings fairly well (that poor phone fell on the concrete so many times before it finally gave up the ghost) but a glass-screened phone could not. After reading reviews and watching videos on Youtube I went with the Otterbox Defender and I really could not be happier I did.I put it on literally as soon as I left the store, and it only comes off my phone occasionally to clean it. I love the peace of mind my Otterbox gives me. I will very happily let babies and small children play with my phone and the only thing I have to worry about is drool. It has been dropped, thrown, and even kicked across the floor (thank you, 3 year old nephew) and my iPhone has not a scratch on it and still works perfectly.I actually put two of the cases together (I had an older black one that made the screen not turn off during calls, so I replaced the front with a newer pink one and kept the black back and outer skin) since I liked the sticky-ness of the older skin (I can set it on my dashboard in my car and it won't move while I'm driving... I like that) but wanted the faceplate fix.Other than the old front-cover having that issue with the screen not turning off during phone calls (which has been fixed), I have absolutely no complaints about my Otterbox. I honestly can't count how many times I've dropped my phone (on hardwood, concrete, asphalt, etc...) with absolutely no issues.

I have dropped my phone countless times, even gotten water on it and when I take it out of this case it looks brand new. My case has some wear and tear, part of the plastic inner part broke a few weeks ago, but the case is still working. It has gotten dirty - how could you expect anything you put on your phone and use on a daily basis to not get dirty? But when it does I just take my phone out of it and use antibacterial wipes to clean it and q-tips. I have only had to clean it about 4 or 5 times in the year I have owned it. Even with getting water on this case (not submerging it!), my iphone has not incurred any damages. In the year, the plastic screen protector (which was the selling point for me), has gotten some minor scratches on it, but again that is to be expected, that's the point of having it there so it doesn't scratch my actual screen. For $30 and a year of use, my iphone still looking brand new, this was an extremely wise investment on my part. I have a 3 year old and a 18 month old, BOTH of whom play games on my iphone 4 and have dropped it etc and this case took it all in stride.

Right off the bat it was apparent something was off as they both came in different packaging. However, I attributed that to the fact that they came from different vendors.Installed the W/GG case first, fit well and appeared to function as advertised. Installed the O/NB case on a separate phone some weeks later and here's where the difference became evident. Whilst the case appears to provide the same protection it definitely is not the same material as the other case. The W/GG has a rubbery non-slick texture that feels good whereas the O/NB feels 'plasticky' and is quite stiff. So stiff that depressing the Iphone home button is a feat of superhuman strength (well just more than average and very uncomfortable)I thought that perhaps I had installed the case incorrectly (didn't really see how since it's so simple) but two attempts later same problem with the home button. I've eventually had to resort to enabling a setting for the impaired that gives an onscreen icon that provides several functions including a home button.Five stars for protection and aesthetics on both cases (get regular compliments), less two for difference in quality of the outer skin and the issue with the home button on the O/NB case.",3.0,The good and the bad,1360627200,"02 12, 2013"

The only thing that will break the phone is if something hits the screen directly.  It is very thick; don't plan on keeping this in your pocket unless it's a utility pocket on cargo pants.  It is not at all water nor splash proof.  It isn't even dust proof.  In fact, it seems to collect dust very readily between the screen and case, so you end up with little bits of lint that look like stuck pixels on the screen until you take it apart and clean them out.My friend and I bought one of these, and both of us had the same problem.  The silicon bumper encasing the plastic enclosure comes apart within a year.  First it starts growing for some reason; it somehow gets bigger and starts looking like it was made for a bigger case.  After the bumper ""grows"" enough, then the weak points of the bumper start breaking.  The bottom port cover tears off first.  Then the small bits of rubber around the edges where the case snaps together.  Then the headphone port cover.Finally, bigger bits start falling off.  After 2 years, I gave up trying to keep it together and got an awesome Lifeproof case.After all the hype I've always heard about how great Otterbox cases are, I was very disappointed.  I would not recommend any case with a silicon or rubber bumper around it that isn't integrated (and glued to the case).  That bumper is just going to degrade and expand over time simply due to its chemical composition, and there's nothing you can do about it.",2.0,Bad silicon bumper,1381017600,"10 6, 2013"

3077,1130556,A3B9EOUXZ494CL,B005SUHPO6,C. Clark,"[1, 1]","I loved myOtterBox Universal Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black Silicone & Black Plastic), even though I had two issues with it (one issue was when the clip on the holster that holds the phone in place broke off, and another was when the tab on the right side of the case that holds the case together broke off while trying to take the phone out one day) - OtterBox quickly replaced the holster the first time around, and since I was already planning on picking up a new case for the iPhone 4s, I didn't even bother contacting them about the second issue.This case was not bulk packaged - it came in full retail packaging.Having owned the previous model, this one shows some vast improvement. The holster is the exact same.However the case is definitely different. The hole for the ear, font camera, and proximity sensor is all one hole, making it easier to clean that area, as well as resolve some of the proximity sensor issues that the old case had (even with the black iPhone 4, I was constantly face dialing with the old case on the phone). No longer with the new iPhone 4s case!On the back of the case, instead of having a separate holes for the camera and flash, there is now just one big hole. This was to correct some of the issues with the flash being slightly covered and causing shadows on pictures, and it now works fine with the single hole.Another HUGE improvement is the silicone that covers the case. On the old iPhone 4 case, it was a little thin and tended to droop off the hard plastic. This was annoying but not a huge issue. With the new iPhone 4s case, the silicone is much thicker and stays put.

I'm amazed at how much trouble some people have when assembling it. If you watch the online video on the OtterBox site, it will take maybe 5 minutes total. Brain-dead easy. Regarding some of the other complaints people have made:- It's too bulky . . . Actually, it's a lot less bulky than I originally expected once I saw it in-person. Thicker than the typical rubber or metal 3-sided case or bumper, but definitely not ""scary-thick."" Plus, I'm a notorious ""dropper"" of phones, having ruined a few Razrs in the past, and this case really does a great job. I've probably dropped my iPhone accidentally from several feet onto concrete 4 to 5 times since I got my case, and have had no problem at all.- It's hard to pull out of my jeans . . . maybe for tight girl-jeans, but regular guy-jeans are fine for the most part, although you WILL see a small resistance due to the soft exterior. But nothing that's unbearable. Once again, the protection makes up for any small inconvenience, and I prefer the slightly textured rubber exterior for normal phone use versus smooth plastic. Makes for a solid grip that doesn't slip out of my hand.- It's hard to remove the case from its holster with one hand . . . maybe if you have arthritis or some other malady. But I do it with one hand while on a ladder or in similar one-handed situations all the time.- The belt clip is flimsy . . . by what standard? I've found it easy to use and it has held up well under repeated use.- The flap on the top covers my microphone . . . actually, the flap on the top of the 4S version doesn't cover the 4S microphone (the hole in the flap is for the mike), but it DOES cover the headphone jack, and that is by design in order to help keep dust away from the phone. If you have a 4S, you just need to make sure you get the case that's DESIGNED FOR the 4S, not the one for the 4. Some people find the flap inconvenient for headphone use, I like it for keeping dust out. And it's rubber, not plastic as one reviewer commented.- This case is a fake, and not a real OtterBox. That's why it's so cheap on Amazon . . . I've now bought 2 off this SKU on Amazon, and both are completely legit. Same build-quality as normal from Otter Products, and I've compared the box, print, etc. at 2 retailers. Exactly the same. If yours isn't, I would bet that Amazon will make it right. Most things cost less at Amazon. Enjoy it.- The holster is too geeky to use . . . well, yeah I get that, if you're trying to get a date or at least, not look like you're stuck in the '90's. But if you climb on ladders or climb rocks or hike a lot, you'll be glad you have one for those scenarios. Or if you need to transport it in a gym bag or piece of luggage and want to protect the glass front. My wife (as one would expect the case to be with most women) wouldn't be caught dead wearing one, but likes the idea of using it to protect the front of her phone when in a similar situation.I haven't had either of mine long enough to experience any tears or other fatigue on the rubber flaps, and I don't use a docking system, so I haven't experienced the problem others have encountered with their docks not being usable any longer without an adapter. (If I do run into problems with the flaps, Otter Products has already said they'll stand behind the design. Either way, I'll return here and report on it.) But this is by far the best overall case for the money that I've found in 6 months of searching. The only other case I considered seriously was the Lifeproof, but at $80, the price was a bit stout. However, if you expect to be in wet conditions a lot, and/or simply prefer a thinner case and one with a smooth plastic feel, the price difference is not that high when you consider it's protecting a $200-$400 investment at minimum, so you might want to check that one out. But at the Amazon price and for my purposes, the OtterBox Defender can't be beat.",5.0,Best case for the money for the iPhone 4S,1330560000,"03 1, 2012"

What matters more to you is a personal preference. Some cases look great but barely protect what's important - others balance that and add more bulk but become less cute as they do.With the Otterbox Defender, you are choosing the ""Protection"" side of the continuum in a big way.I thought I'd be put off by the bulk of the case, and while it is somewhat bulky, it doesn't really bug me much. The peace of mind of knowing I won't kill the phone with a drop on concrete makes it easy to live with.This fits my AT&T; 4S very well. Everything pretty much fits in the right place. Contrary to other reviewer's experiences, the Teal color of my case is exactly as you see it in the pics here on Amazon. It looks sharp with my white iPhone as just a little bit of the white exterior is still shown surrounding the screen. It effectively makes this a tri-color case.What I don't like: The screen ""membrane"". It protects the screen, but it shields over that nice retina display a little too well, detracting a little from its sharpness. I also don't like how you can feel (slightly) the plastic under your fingers when using the touchscreen. It's non-removable; it's part of the design of the case. Again, it's one of the trade-offs. Do you want to major in protection, and minor in convenience/elegance, or vice versa?With that said, the screen protector membrane does what it's there to do, and I can still use the touchscreen just fine. The screen is just as responsive as it would be without it, and if it wasn't there, it would defeat the purpose of such a stout case. It's just my least favorite part of the item. At least there are no more ""blobs"" on the screen like I had to deal with when I had a Defender for my iPhone 3GS.You also can forget using pretty much any kind of dock with this case. The phone does not come out of the case quickly or easily for a quick dock connect. It's intended to stay in the case. Also, the rubber flap that covers the dock connector port doesn't bend much past a 90 degree angle. When you open it to access the port, there is a tension the case creates that wants to close the rubber opening. This makes it hard to fit into even wide docks or charging stations. It is, however, large enough for any 30-pin connector cable, even an oversized one. Same with the headphone jack - it's covered but opens up to accomodate just about any headphone jack.What I do like: Pretty much everything else. It's comforting to know my phone is protected from drops, dust, scratches, and other threats. This case is solid and protects very, very well, while looking stylish. It doesn't attract much dust for a silicone case.The Otterbox Defender feels very secure in your hands which takes your mind off of not damaging the phone and allows you to.....just use it.",4.0,"If you want protection, this is your case",1325980800,"01 8, 2012"

I have purchased over 20 of these cases, mostly for iPhones over the past three years. You see, I have 10 phones on my account (2 Family plans) and at one time, nine were iPhones. Over 3 years, I went through several upgrades from 3GS to 4 or 4S. Two of my phones are now Android phones including the Galaxy S3 which is also protected by Otterbox.To begin with, the Defender case is well designed with a hard plastic case inside a shock absorbing silicon cover. The hard inner case includes a permanent screen protector that is thicker and more protective than the typical peel and stick variety. All ports and buttons on the phone are accessible through the case via pop-open covers, penetrations or button extensions on the outer case. The case also comes with a beltclip if you don't want to put it in your pocket.Many cases make it difficult to charge your phone while the case is on. The Otterbox Defender provides a port opening with silicon pop-open cover to charge your iPhone or Galaxy S3 with the factory charger. Some after market iPhone chargers won't plug in to your phone with this case installed because the dimensions are not per factory specs.I have personnally dropped my phones hundreds, if not thousands, of times and I have had only two phones get damaged while protected by an Otterbox Defender. The first was when my son dropped his iPhone 3GS on the sidewalk and it landed screen down on a pebble that was just a little taller than the recess from the case edge to the screen. I don't know of any case that would have protected against that fluke. The second phone went for a swim in the toilet. When you see the case construction you may be tempted to believe it is water proof... IT IS NOT! Nor does Otterbox make any claims that it is.Recently while climbing into my wife's SUV, my Samsung Galaxy S3 came flying off of my belt as I climbed in. It bounced off of the driveway a few times but sustained no damage. When I retrived it and the beltclip, I found that the clip had actually broken and that was why the phone had fallen. I called Otterbox warranty service and described the event. I did not have to fight them at all, they replaced the clip under warranty at no cost to me.Lastly, my youngest son is quadriplegic with limited arm movement and no finger or wrist control.

I have butter fingers, and I've dropped my phone to many times to count. I love this case, but they grey rubber does get dirty after a while, and it's difficult to clean. I suppose I can live with it considering how protected my phone it. I'm still not 100% happy about the clear film that covers the screen. No matter how many times I clean it, there's always something (a hair, a speck of dust) that gets caught behind it and it's very annoying.

Really protects the phone (I've dropped my phone countless times and nothing has happened to it or the case itself).2. The colours make it easy to find in my purse (I purchased the grey/pink version).3. The volume buttons are readily available without flipping a section of the rubber layer away.4.

I had an armored flip phone before because I am a klutz and rough on phones.  This is an even worse problem due to the large size of the 4S.  The Otterbox silicone/plastic case has protected my phone from 4 drops onto hard surfaces very well - major plus!  I don't like how it bulks up the phone and the silicone is so grippy that it is hard to get out of a pocket, but that may be a good thing as it won't fall out of my shirt pocket very easily, but I have missed a couple of calls because of it.I have a major problem with the holster though.  The iPhone/case fits in the holster pretty well but if you are not absolutely careful you think you have it in and locked but it is easy to miss and the phone will fall out.  The worst problem is that the belt clip is a disaster!  It is kind of a weak spring so it can come off pretty easy any way, but the killer is that for some reason they decided to put a click and hold open tab on the clip.  I don't know why this is a good feature at all.  Because of the weak spring loaded clip, coupled with the click open tab which engages every time you open the clip, I have dropped the phone 3x!!!  The holster and phone fall off my belt almost every time I get out of my car and sometimes when I sit up from a chair/sofa.  Bending my waist causes the clip to open easily.  I would have dropped the phone on the ground multiple times more if it hadn't got hung up in my jacket and I grabbed it.

Kind of like having a tire around my delicate phone, but that's not a bad thing as I've come to realize that I drop my phone often.  Handler faults, the Defender protects it well.  Two things could make it better:1. I've discovered that anything *purple* that comes in silicone is going to change color.  I bought my cover in January, and by March the purple had turned a muddy grey-purple. Ugly!  I once had a curlicue wrist key chain holder in purple.  That turned color, too.  My husband has a blue defender cover, no color change, still like new and he uses his daily.  Lesson learned: Avoid purple, opt instead for another color.  I just ordered the teal.2.  I can't seem to get rid of the orange peel effect in the window.  It's very bothersome.  I need to take the cover completely apart to get rid of it, but as the touch pad is used over the course of a day, the orange peel effect gradually returns in a few days.  I think there's not a 100% contact between the cover and the phone.  Someone told me that sprinkling cornstarch inside will take care of it, but I've not seen that confirmed anywhere so don't want to take any chances.  Better the orange peel effect than ruining a phone!  Since my husband's Defender case is not as problematic, I'm hoping the issue is just with my current cover and will be better with the new one.  Again, problems are not bad enough to not by this product again as the protection is excellent.All in all, aside from the minor irritations noted above, this is a good product that provides the promised protection.",3.0,"Not Bad, but Not Great = 3",1372464000,"06 29, 2013"

I put the phone in my pants front pocket with my leather covered money clip and a paper napkin and to further protect the phone, (and my side from indentations in it). 45 minutes later I pulled the phone out to check the Stock Market Indexes, and there it was. A large scuff mark on the plastic that covered the screen, plus several other large scratches on it in other spots. What a bummer.

47,1127526,A21299JHP56S98,B005SUHPO6,AAA,"[2, 2]","Came today. Here is my first impression.PROS* Custom-designed for the iPhone 4S. Nothing is covered up that shouldn't be.* Comes with screen cover. Hard to tell in the product photo. (see cons)* Well-designed cover flaps. The power socket, silent-mode switch, and earphone jack are covered by silicone flaps that bend out when you want access. The front button, on/off button, and volume buttons are covered by protective silicone buttons that are permanently in place. Everything else (except the screen) is fully exposed all the time: front camera, earpiece, infra-red sensor, external speaker, microphone, light sensor, rear camera, flash, and Apple logo.CONS* Clear plastic screen cover is glossy, versus the matte iPhone screen. You will have to tilt the phone to avoid looking directly into the ceiling lights.* Plastic screen does not cling to iPhone, like those protective sheets you can buy separately and stick on. This results in 2 negative side-effects: First, the picture is somewhat distorted because the clear plastic sheet does not sit directly on the screen. It bends and warps slightly, and sometimes the pixels inflate, like a drop of water on your computer monitor. Second, you have to press more firmly to operate the touch-screen. I sometimes find myself swiping the screen and nothing happens. It should be noted that I also have a separately-purchased plastic screen cover, so 2 screen covers total.* Bulky. iPhone is almost twice as thick now, and no longer fits in the vinyl holster I bought separately. The product photo is deceiving. The case adds about 1/4 inch to all 6 sides of the iPhone.* Hard to take out of holster, hard to put back in. Requires two hands. Very awkward, very bulky.* Holster leaves one side of phone exposed - you can choose to leave the screen facing out, or the giant Apple logo and camera lens.* Holster is huge and ugly. You will look like a geek wearing it. It is a big rectangle of hard plastic, and the case snaps onto it and held in place by a shelf on the bottom and a latch on top that grips the case in place.* The box says the holster doubles as a movie-watching stand, but it is not clear how to do this. It does not come with instructions on how to use it this way.OTHER THOUGHTS* Case is mostly hard plastic, with an outer silicone layer. The silicone offers a nice grip, but I can still slide it into and out of my pants pocket.",4.0,Very Protective But Very Bulky,1322697600,"12 1, 2011"

It's hard plastic and rubber, and the screen protector is sort of built into the case, rather than being a sheet that adheres to the screen (there's one for the front and back of the phone).

You can also snap the phone into the holster and rotate the clip, using the holster as a stand to prop up your phone. I don't particularly like the rubber because it attracts grit and dust and is difficult to clean. I also use my phone frequently as an iPod, so I find the flap over the earbud jack kind of annoying. The flap has a hole in it, but the hole is not over the jack - you have to open the rubber flap to insert the earbud cord.

(Thrilled with the phone btw!!!!) But, the product has been fantastic at protecting the phone.  I've dropped it and it withstands use by my two toddlers, so it passes the test!  My only complaint is that I have to take the phone out of the case approximately once a week to clean the inside of the screen protector due to some smearing that occurs over time.  I did contact their customer service department and they suggested using a fine mist of baby powder or a dryer sheet to reduce the static, which is what causes the appearance of smearing underneath.  They did offer to replace it if the problem wasn't corrected, but so far it has not been a big deal for me.  Overall, in spite of the minor issue I just described, I would still recommend it as an excellent way to protect the money invested into an iPhone.

Fits tightly for a month or two anyway.

The only problem was that the silicon rubber was wearing out and would not close properly.  I read the reviews for the LifeProof and thought I would give it a shot.

It sounded muffled compared to the sound in the otterbox defender.  Plus, there was an air void between the case and my iphone screen that I never noticed with the otterbox, which made the touch screen not as sensitive resulting in me having to 'touch' harder or multiple times in order to get apps to open or the lock to come off the phone.

The specs claim that the case is only 0.29&#34; thicker (than the 0.37&#34; phone), but it seems to more than double the thickness of the phone.  Perhaps this perception is because the case is very boxy and rectangular.  I know it's an older phone and an older case design, but the OtterBox Defender for the Samsung Galaxy S4 is slimmer (0.25&#34; thicker than the phone) and more streamlined with curves.Second, the soft rubber outer skin relaxes in about a year, just when the warranty expires.  After regular use, all of the flexible port covers will not snap back into place; they flop around.  And the skin sags and pops out of it's track.

Without the jacket, the hard plastic skeleton was awkward to hold so I stopped using the case altogether. When I took my phone out, it looked brand new, within a month of using my phone without a case and I'd already dropped it enough times to result in permanent scratches... time for a new Otterbox.As other users have mentioned, this case is a vast improvement from the previous series, particularly the silicone jacket. Now it's much tougher, harder to stretch, and ""feels"" like it's made of higher quality stuff... the only downside is that I find  the semi-glossy finish shows scuffs and scratches easier, at least with the darker colors.Also changed are the front and back camera windows. They're much more exposed, with no plastic covering either the front or the back camera, but you can take much cleaner pictures as a result.If you're new to the OtterBox Defender series be warned that this isn't so much a case as it is a miniature fortress for your phone; it adds considerable amount of bulk and weight, which may not be practical for some. While the silicone jacket is added for easy grip and comfortable holding, it also prevents the phone from sliding in an our of your bag or jacket pocket, so it can lead to some awkward moments when you're trying to take out your phone.With all that said, the life of my phone has been saved countless times thanks to OtterBox, and for that the minor inconveniences are hardly worth mentioning.",4.0,An Otter Improvement,1370476800,"06 6, 2013"

Upon receiving this case, I was very excited, although when I was putting it on my iPhone, I noticed that the silicone part of the OtterBox was very &#34;stretchy&#34;.  The silicone was unusual because it was very soft and loose.At first, I enjoyed owning my new case, but many of my friends and family had the OtterBox Defender Series case, and it was evident that my case was different.  Although the OtterBox website describes the outermost &#34;shell&#34; of the Defender Series case as silicone, the real OtterBox has actually more of a &#34;hard rubber&#34; texture.  The OtterBox I ordered from here is definitely soft silicone.To be quite honest, I am not the most careful person with iPhones, so I thought that the OtterBox was perfect.  But because this case has port covers that can be opened and closed, I was frequently opening and closing them to charge my phone and listen to music, and eventually that caused the silicone part to rip and tear.  I then started having suspicions about this case.  Also, this case supposedly prevents dust from entering, but I found that every week I was taking my case off and cleaning my iPhone, which was a great hassle.  I knew that there was something wrong with just my case, because my sister had never had to take off her OtterBox and clean her phone.Eventually, I was getting tired of the color and getting tired of accidentally ripping my case, so I ordered a new customized OtterBox from the actual OtterBox website.  I just received it today and the &#34;silicone&#34; on that one is much more durable, and not as stretchy.  Even putting it on my phone was a challenge because the material was not stretchy at all, which I am glad with.  The case I ordered from here was easy to put on because the material was so weak!  I also compared my OtterBox from here with my new OtterBox, and it became evident that the one ordered from here was cut slightly differently.My point is that the OtterBox from here could be a knockoff of the real one.  I will say that I was happy about the price, and it did protect my phone on multiple occasions, but it definitely was not giving my phone full protection from dust and such.  So if you plan on getting this case here, don't expect the full OtterBox experience.  It's possible that some people here got a real OtterBox, but I believe mine was a cheap knockoff, as I was able to compare with others who ordered from the actual website.Pros:Protects iPhone from dropsLooks just like a real OtterBoxCons:Soft silicone material rips easily and is thinner than an OtterBox bought from the company websiteDust enters quicklyCovered ports won't stay covered if the silicone even has a small rip in themAlso: When I ordered this case, I had a feeling that I had a used one because first the box was opened, and second, the back of the silicone had a bit of pink paint on it which never fully came off.",3.0,"Looks and feels like a real OtterBox, but doesn't protect and give you the full experience of one",1383350400,"11 2, 2013"

It seems to provide excellent protection for my iPhone - I even (accidentally) dropped it onto concrete from about 20' (won't do that again!) and the box itself didn't even pick up a scuff.  But the openings don't always accommodate peripherals.  To use some third-party headphones, for example, you have to take the phone out of the box (believe me, once you get it safely tucked in, you don't want to have to bother taking it out) because the little flap opening provided won't allow the jack to seat all the way into the phone.  It's fine with the earbuds furnished with the phone by Apple - if you like the earbuds.  However, you have to remove the box from the holster no matter whose plug-in you're using to get at the edge for the opening flaps (including the synch port.  That's the only drawback, in my opinion.  It does provide raised buttons to put the phone to sleep, turn it off, go to home or adjust volume, and they work fine.Update - after extended use, I have one more con to this product:  Synching the iPhone requires you to open a bottom flap to expose the port.  After so many months of this, the lower section of the outside case no longer fits snug against the inner hard case, allowing the outer case to become a dust catcher (or let moisture in against the phone).  Still works, but I'm not as impressed as I was at the outset - I would rate this 3 1/2 stars if I could.",4.0,"Excellent protection, hampers full use of iPhone (update)",1323907200,"12 15, 2011"

Based upon conversations with friends and after doing some research, I purchased the OTTERBOX DEFENDER FOR IPHONE 4 to protect my iPhone 4. I would never own a smart phone without having excellent protection for it. Smart phones (even ones from 2-3 generations ago) are not inexpensive to replace. Also, I&#8217;m kind of a klutz: I tend to occasionally drop my phone at the most inopportune times (on the blacktop of the parking lot after getting out of the car, for instance); so not having something that really protects my phone is not an option.After having placed the OTTERBOX DEFENDER FOR IPHONE 4 on my phone almost immediately after purchasing it seven months ago, I can say that I am satisfied with this product. I have dropped by phone countless times on concrete, blacktop, and in one instance down a stairwell. My iphone4 has been protected and doesn&#8217;t have one scratch on it. Also, although the case is not waterproof, it does provide some basic protection to a phone from raindrops and other very small droplets of water (you can&#8217;t drop your phone in the toilet or use it in the shower, but if you&#8217;re carrying it in your pocket during a rainstorm, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about it too much).Also, although the OTTERBOX DEFENDER FOR IPHONE4 is fairly heavy, I like the overall look and feel of it.With that said, I do have a couple complaints about the item. First, in the summer when carrying my phone in my pocket, the case of the phone seems to attract sweat to it. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s absorbing the sweat from my pants/shorts pocket or what, but there were numerous instances over the summer that I had to completely take my phone out of the Otterbox case so I could wipe away the liquid buildup that had somehow accumulated.Secondly, the outer silicone covering of the case is rather flimsy and feels like rubber and is not as durable as I thought it would be. Currently, after seven months of use, the little flaps covering the volume switch and the USB port have worn away and are now only staying in place by a small piece of the silicone. I find this quite disappointing.Overall, my OTTERBOX DEFENDER FOR IPHONE4  has been a worthwhile investment. There are some minor flaws with the product, but the case has kept my phone safe and protected. With that said, these flaws will make me seriously look at other products in the future (such as the LifeProof case).",4.0,Will Keep Your Phone Safe from Falls and Drops,1387324800,"12 18, 2013"

Our kids broke the screen on my wife's first phone (which prompted us to get these) and was totally able to use her cracked screen like a regular one without getting glass in her fingers becuse of the screen protector. I do put mine in my pocket a lot which tends to wear out he ribber faster I think. The flaps that cover the headphone jack and charger input tend to wear quickly if you use those areas a lot. It seems like the average time this last me was six months. Keep in mind that is with constant barrage of kid testing. $30 every 6 months to protect my phone is way better than the $10/month insurance that makes you pay another $150 to replace your iPhone. Get this it's worth it.Almost forgot. The size is bigger (obviously) than your normal phone but you get used to it very quickly and it's way less of an issue than you think it is.",5.0,Perfect protection from Kids,1371600000,"06 19, 2013"

I am a rocket scientist and now brain surgeon.  I should be able to put this together.  I have better than average dexterity.  It was finicky and hard to manipulate the edges so that they are attached to front of the phone and smooth.  The rubberized material is sticky and sliding in was complex and didn't work all the materials to the right spots.2.  The headphone jack does not just look like it is in wrong place, it is in the wrong place.  I have to open the cover to use it.  The holes do not align correctly and yes, I did assemble it correctly.3.  Wow is this bulky.  It has to triple the thickness of the phone.  On the other side, I have dropped it several times from some height without damaging the phone.4.  The belt clip secures to your belt but it is somewhat awkward to get the clip to work.  Unlike other clips, you remove the phone to the side by pushing a tab.  It seems durable but is finicky to get it attach correctly without carefully looking and feeling it snap into the slot.5.  The phone works reasonably well and I have a minimum of dropped calls.  The screen touch and feel is flawlessOverall, not bad for what it is but the gushing reviews oversell it.  It is big and bulky and if you are getting a big and bulky phone, that wouldn't be too bad but come on, this is for the iPhone.  It is supposed to be sleek and stylish and should just work.

You'll need to open a little cover flap to plug in headphones with this case on.2) This case is so thick that you can forget about using any sort of dock for your iPhone.So if you can live with those limits, this could well be the nearly bulletproof case you want for your iPhone.",4.0,"Lots of protection, but with some issues....",1337644800,"05 22, 2012"

(If you're looking for a slimmer case that still offers good protection, try the OtterBox Commuter Series.)I'm a big fan of the OtterBox cases.  (I've tried a number of others, and they don't really stack up.)- OtterBoxes are well designed - they include the features I want, and some I didn't know I needed.- They fit well, and more generally match the features of the phone carefully.  OtterBox gets something that apparently isn't obvious to other case makers - you not only want to use all the features of the phone, but you want to use them in an easy and enjoyable way.- The materials are well chosen to provide strength, grip and durability.  (That said, some of my Defender cases developed splits in the skinnier bits, like near the connector.)The screen protector is well made and reasonably easy to apply.  Be sure to put it on.  A few tips for applying the screen protector:- Clean it with a damp, soft, lint free, cotton cloth.  (Cotton is a softer fiber than paper or synthetic fabrics.)  An old cotton dishtowel or t-shirt is a good bet.  (The old part means it has less lint.)  Let it dry.- Look at the screen carefully to remove all the lint before starting.- Before removing the adhesive covering sheet, line up the screen protector and get a sense for how it fits.  Make a plan to align it with an edge and the main button.  Note how much space you have on either long side, so you know where it needs to be to fit properly on the main button.- After removing the adhesive covering on the screen protector, apply it to one edge - I use a long edge to get it on straight, checking the main button location - and work your way to the other side.- Squeeze out the bubbles from the center outward, in each direction.I get a year or two out of the screen protectors, so it's worth some effort to get it on right.I like the fact that the headphone jack has a cover, as I don't use it a lot I prefer to keep out the fuzz and goo.

My overall opinion hasn't changed but I appreciate being corrected about the misunderstood functionality.------------I hated it as soon as I got it on but used it for a few days to see if I would change my mind about it.Really, it's defective and I should return it. The audio port doesn't line up with the phone so the rubber flap is useless. The rubber flaps are cumbersome and while they can be forced to snug into the plastic shell case, it's not worth the time fiddle with them. Thus, it's not really a seamless design and makes the case feel clunky. It doesn't help that it's absurdly large. Gigantic really. The upside is that it could withstand a fall from a building or something equally impractical.The plastic screen cover is pointless. It's not going to protect the screen from anything, gets very dirty and right out of the box, makes the Retina display look like a cheap plastic screen found on knockoffs. It distorts the sharpness of the screen. I don't understand the purpose since the iPhone screen is already very strong. It can't be for waterproofing because the flaps would easily let sand, dust, snow or water into the device.The size of this case is absurd. It's size is disproportionate to the level of protection it provides. Simply unnecessary that it be this bulky and not truly seal up (least of all with proper inputs matched up...)One of the biggest features for me was the included belt clip and this is gigantic and clunky as well. It's clever that you can rotate the clip and use as a stand but it's not worth the bulk, which wasn't apparent to me in the photos. The latching in of the phone isn't smooth and the removal is much worse. There's not a good way to detach and hold the phone securely with one hand. Instead, I have to unclip, remove with two hands. Insertion also requires two hands because you have to remove everything near it because it's easy to have a shirt or jacket caught in it.TL;DR Version:Chunky, clunky, poor fit and defective pairing of case and device ports. Cheap feel and absurdly large with a belt clip to match.",2.0,"Not very practical, clunky and a cheap feel.",1321747200,"11 20, 2011"

Yeah, they are bulky but I get peace of mind knowing that if I drop my phone anywhere, it will be protected. I have an iPhone 4 but I liked the colors of the new iPhone 4s cases. These cases fit the iPhone 4 just fine. The nice part about these new cases is the flexible silicone is MUCH less sticky in texture as the older once. They slide into your pocket easier and they don't collect lint and dust. They also don't stretch out. This is a NICE change.The colors on the internet are not at all what the true colors are like. The silicone color is not a dark teal, but rather a light teal and the plastic part is a very light turquoise. It is still pretty, but I would have preferred the colors that are pictured.The other con I feel is that they took away the plastic shield that covers the camera on the front and back of the phone. I am not sure why they did that, but now dust gets on to the phone much more easily, plus your cameras can get scratched. What I did to solve this problem was use the plastic from the iPhone 4 Defender series (with the camera shields) and put the teal silicone from the iPhone 4s Defender.

Small particles are always getting stuck behind the screen protector, which forced me to remove & clean my iPhone TOO often, 2. The outer rubber bumper no longer had a snug fit and my phone was exposed at certain points, 3. The bottom tab (over the USB port) was flimsy and eventually fell off completely, 4. The one year warranty is a waste of time. WHY would I want to exchange the defective Defender for the same overhyped iPhone case ?? They should let people get another model instead. , and 5.

It fits over my iphone4S perfectly. A bit bulkier than the slimmer, stylin' phone covers out there, but if you want real protection, Otterbox is a top brand. I have an active lifestyle and needed something that could take the bumps and scrapes of outdoor sports, but would also look sleek at a nice restaurant.The photo gives the impression that the yellow part has a gun metal sheen to it. This is not the case. It is a hard plastic yellow. Reminds me of the color matte of a yellow kayak. And the ""gun metal grey"" actually looks like a ""soft, palatable grey"". Still, it's a nice color combination.My only concern are the flaps used in the outer rubberized shell. I like that they really protect the phone from dirt, and provide a tad bit more water resistance, but they can be a pain to open and close all the time. There is a flap to protect the charger insert (pretty good idea, but makes nesting the iphone difficult), as well as a flap over the Silent on/off switch (a pain in the neck). There is also a flap that covers the headset insert (no biggie). You have to pry these flaps open like little doors, and my concern is that with time, the flaps will eventually rip.

We'll see what happen with the flaps.ADDENDUM: Well, it's been 15 months since I purchased this, and the flap that covers the charger port finally did tear off from wear. The ""hinges"" on the other flaps are beginning to thin as well. The outer grey cover has also warped a teeny bit. It shifts around the yellow hard plastic casing a little, definitely not as snug as when I first bought it. Still, it has protected my iphone from many drops and mishaps, including once when I accidentally dropped it face-down onto pavement, and another time when it chittered down the subway steps in New York.

The case was built like a tank! It did a great job protecting the phone. The only thing it didn't do was come out of my pocket. I could never get it out of my pocket in time to answer the phone before it went to voice mail or the caller lost all hope and hung up. So I went to a smaller Otterbox case (Commuter?) which didn't offer the tank-like protection, but did OK and it got along well with my pocket. The point: When I got the iPhone 4, I hesitated on the Defender because I didn't want to relive the pocket problem and I don't like wearing the phone on my belt (even thought the Defender comes with an attachment for that). The new Defender is solid and very substantial, but it's not as heavy as the old one (a good thing) and it's made of a different material. The new stuff has done a great job of protecting the phone from me and from other environmental hazards, and it passed the pocket test!I would suggest to the Otter folks that they consider providing the option to buy the Defender with or without the belt mounting appliance. They MIGHT already offer it that way, but I didn't find any. I'm sure lots of folks use the belt mount, but mine is still safely in the box.For people who wondered about the ""echo"" that existed with earlier Defender series cases: I have noticed no echo on this case.",5.0,Love the Defender!,1334275200,"04 13, 2012"

After the easy assembly, I tested it out by dropping my iPhone 4s (encased in the otterbox) from 6 feet high directly onto the concrete, and it didn't break, didn't shatter, didn't so much as leave a scratch ANYWHERE on the device OR the Otterbox... I am IMMENSELY impressed by the performance of the Otterbox. This is the ONLY case I will EVER buy, if needed in the future. Also, the holster holds the box securely, as it snaps into place, with the face of the phone facing in. It can also face outward to view movies, videos, etc., thought it doesn't hold as securely when facing out. I don't believe that they intended it to face outward when clipped to your belt, so this is fine. Besides, why would you want it to face out?? Anyway, when snapped into the holster, I tried yanking on it, very hard, and it would not release. It released right away when pulling up on the attached lever of course, so that's that. Now, the screen protector. It's great! It functions perfectly, allowing a full range of functionality with the touch screen. And it's nice and solid, so I'm sure it will hold up to scratches and so on just fine (I didn't test this, but I believe it will be fine). Also, I got it in blue, because I LOVE the L.A. Dodgers, and it fit good with the apparel I wear regularly; There is a circular cut-out on the back (which also is covered by a protective sheet of clear plastic) allowing a view of the Apple logo. After I put the box on my phone and did the tests, I got the idea to put a Dodgers logo inside the circular cut-out, over the Apple logo, and I must say, it looks GREAT! All-in-all, I give the Otterbox a 10 out of 10 in all categories. THIS IS THE ONLY PHONE CASE/HOLSTER YOU WILL EVER NEED OR SHOULD BUY. Trust me on this. It IS a little more expensive than other cases/holsters out there, but it more than makes up for that in quality. I recommend the Otterbox to EVERYONE. You won't regret buying it.

The first of many complaints is that the thing is massive and ugly enough to make you forget you bought an iphone. The two piece case design adds about an inch of depth to a phone that you paid 300 bucks to be thin. Not only this but it doesn't last at all. After a few months of regular use the rubber began to disentegrate and somehow expand to the point that it hung limply off of the hard plastic part. This problem I believe was caused by the fact that the rubber is sticky. Sticky like those fly catchers people hang from the ceiling, especially when it gets moist. Pulling it in and out of your pocket over and over stretch the rubber causing said problem. The screeen protector, well lets see, oh wait! You cant. Atleast well. The thing creates some sort of strange illusion when held at the wrong angle rendering your retina display ugly and useless. Also when moisture gets into it, and it does, you get a weird kaleidascope effect around the edges which requires immediate attention. The feel of it is reminiscent of those early touch screens in which you had to press in untill hitting some weird second layer to get anything to work. Will it protect your phone? You bet! Will it still look like an iphone? Nope. If you dont have pockets and live in a desert where there is a frequent risk of your phone being run over by a semi truck then I recommend this product.

Buyers should be aware that it does add bulk, and the outside is rubbery, which sometimes makes it difficult to slide into a pocket.  That being said, it is total protection for your phone, including the screen.  The case is in parts, and the inside hard plastic part has an integrated screen protector that is virtually invisible when on your phone.  I haven't noticed any discernible difference in the screen sensitivity with it on. The outside rubber cover does change the feel of the controls on the phone.  You'll have to push them a little harder than you do without it on, but you get used to it quickly. I have dropped my phone a few times on hard surfaces with this case on it, and my phone hasn't suffered a bit of damage.  You might read elsewhere that this case is waterproof. It is not waterPROOF, but it will likely protect your phone from rain, spills, etc, as long as you wipe it off quickly.  If you dunk it in water, your phone WILL get wet.  All in all, there isn't a better case on the market for protecting your phone, in my opinion. If this one is too bulky for you, or you don't like the rubbery outside, I'd recommend the Otterbox Commuter. It's still 2 parts, but the rubbery part is on the inside, meaning the outside is slicker and easier to slide into a pocket or purse.  It's also slimmer and much less bulky.  I actually use both types, depending on where I'll be and what I'll be doing: The Defender for travel and outdoor activities, the Commuter for every day.",5.0,The Best Case for Protecting Your iPhone,1367366400,"05 1, 2013"

Don't get me wrong, protection was never compromised, but the rubber surround was tearing in various places because of the extreme duty the case had seen.  When the port cover finally ripped off, it was time to replace.  The new Otterbox Hybrid iPhone 4/4s Defender case is spectacular.  The entire fit and function of this case seems leaps and bounds ahead of the Otterbox case I originally purchased almost 2 years ago.  It appears that the rubber or silicone compound used for the outer layer has been reengineered to be much better.  It is much stiffer, but more lightweight than the original.  The updated form factor is smaller than the last generation case I had, but still makes me confident in the ability to protect the device.  After installing the new cover, it was apparent that the old generation cover that I thought was the best protection for her iPhone just got a whole lot better!Pros:- Best protection for the iPhone of any case I have used (and that is quite a few)- New rubber compound is much better, fits tighter, and does not collect as much lint and dust from your pocket/purse- Feels much lighter than the previous generation- Gives me piece of mind that I won't have to worry about the phone when (not if) it is dropped next- New openings on the front and rear of the case cameras fix the deficiancies found in the last generation offeringCons:- A little bulkier than some slim cases, but they don't offer near the protection.In summary, this is a great case.  Some people think the price is a con because it is too much.  I have a friend that pays for monthly phone insurance and just dropped a $125 deductible down for a replacement phone after dropping theirs.  If they had an Otterbox Defender on their phone, they would still have the $125.

Others have had issues with certain flaps, the headphone jack flap or the mute button flap, getting ripped off...  my advice is to carefully open them and not to rush it.  It will last a long time that way.  Overall...  an A+ product I would definitely buy again.",5.0,My iPhone Is Totally Protected,1344384000,"08 8, 2012"

But we have children who get their hands on the phone. And accidents happen. So I decided to give it a try.This version of the case is pretty great. Sturdy design. Easy to take apart and put back together for switching to slim case or to clean.The built-in screen protector is pretty awesome. It works well. However, I find that sometimes I can't unlock my phone and other times I can't switch the keyboard mode (to show symbols). It might be an issue with the most recent iOS (5.1), but I haven't been able to determine the cause and another iPhone we have with an Otterbox has the same issue (in the bottom-left corner).The built-in screen protector also works with previously applied screen protectors. So you can have a protector stuck to the screen of your phone, insert the phone into the Otterbox under the built-in protector and the screen is still responsive. I really like this so I can feel comfortable switching cases every now and then.The flaw with the Otterbox design is the rubber skin that goes over the skeleton of the case. For the most part, the pieces that cover the headphone jack, the 30-pin connector, and the mute switch stay well. However, the 30-pin connector cover has stopped staying in place after a few weeks of use. I think there are small rubber notches that are supposed to hold it in place and that one of them has wore down to the point it no longer sticks to the skeleton. It doesn't bother me too much, but it is annoying.Overall, the Otterbox case is amazing. I would recommend anyone to try it out.",4.0,Otterbox Defender Series Hybrid Case & Holster for iPhone 4 & 4S - Retail Packaging - Sun Yellow/Gunmetal Grey,1334620800,"04 17, 2012"

I had one of these cases the 1st day I purchased my iPhone 4, but after a year of use, putting it in and taking it out of my front pocket multiple times a day, the thin strip of rubber casing tore near the headphone jack flap and the rubber casing for the phone became stretched and fit loosely around the inner plastic case.The next time around I purchase a case highly recommended by iLounge, but that case did not last 6 months of front pocket use.So, I've come back to Otterbox Defender and purchased this case.  The case is a bit of a redesign compared to the original iPhone 4 Defender case (maybe to add compatibility with iPhone 4S?), but in my opinion the changes make the case look a bit sleeker.  I have again put the case through plenty of front pocket use and the only sign of wear is some stretching of the rubber outer shell so that it fits looser than the day I purchased the case, but by no means does it fall off of the inner plastic shell.I should mention that my wife's Otterbox Defender for iPhone 4, which she purchased the day she bought her iPhone 4 over two years ago, is as good as new since she keeps the phone in her purse or diaper bag.For the price, I don't think you can beat the protection.

I started using the Otterbox case about 2 years ago (knock on wood) and I haven't broken a phone since.I have worn out a couple Otterbox defender cases, this is my 3rd one, but I will never complain about replacing a case which costs $25 to $30 instead of an iPhone. I currently have the iPhone 4 and this case fits it perfectly, and protects it like a junkyard dog protects a bone.This is a new case for me, and slightlty improved from previous model I owned, which needed replacing from day to day wear (and me dropping it).  Here are my thoughts related to new case vs old Oterbox.The fit is better then the previous one I had, the headphone jack cover is perfectly placed.It is made in Mexico instead of China.The soft plastic-silicon protective outer case is less sticky then older model. This is great because the older one always grabbed cash if it was in the same pocket as money. This one is less likely to stick to your cash because the material is a little smoother.My last Otterbox defender was all black, this one is grey and yellow and it looks cool. Stands out a little more too, means I am less likely to forget it.The plastic shield that covers the glass screen fits perfectly.Ear and camera openings are not covered by clear plastic which is nice because the plastic used to accumulate lint-dirt.Charger and headphone flaps seem less likely to tear, the new material is stiffer.This Otterbox case is great, the only way to improve it now is to make it in America.

So far, so good.Improvements:They appear to have improved the styling so that the case more closely follows the outline of the phone. The outer silicone sleeve that goes over the hard plastic case been textured to make the whole thing more ""grippy"" in the hand and less bulky and slippery.The screen protection has also been upgraded. If you had a 3G Otterbox you had to deal with the ""oilspill"" effect on the screen. The new screen protection has none of that and is still sensitive to the touch.The charging port no longer has a hard plastic collar all the way around it - with the old case I had to file down one of my charging cords to get it in there. On the new case, the hard plastic covers around  of the speakers, but the charging port itself is protected by a silicone flap that is much better at not being in the way.The holster also feels far more secure than the old case (there's an actual clip holding the phone in place) and the rotating belt clip is better centered to make a more stable media stand. Overall, the Otterbox has evolved with the phone in a way that works better for my purposes.2 quick gripes:First, while the Apple logo on the back is protected by a screen cover, the camera lens is not. The case itself adds a few milimeters of bulk, so the lens is recessed into the case and doesn't come in contact with any flat surface when you lay it on its back, but I'm concerned about letting it roam loose in my backpack.Second, the instructions are vague, wordless, small pictures printed on the inside back of the packaging materials which makes them hard to find and read/follow. If you aren't familiar with how to encase your phone, you are better off going to their web site and watching the YouTube video they posted.

It made my connection weak because it puts pressure on the wire while charging. Even when charging in the car, there is the continuous sound of connected, disconnected repeatedly.I also agree with the sensitivity issue. There is no doubt that you must press harder on the screen to get the same results as when the phone is not encased in an otter box. When I remove the otter box, I only need to use a light, gentle tap with the tip of my thumbs to type or make selections. With the case on, I'm literally pushing the screen to type a word. It's annoying at first because you are used to lightening speed, but it's not very hard to get used to it.Like one of the reviewers said, most of people's issues appear to be a result of improper use and ridiculous expectations of a case that's meant to really safeguard your expensive phone/computer.I was also fortunate enough not to get a fake one. I use it when I'm going somewhere with my toddler, who might end up using it, keeping him entertained and I don't worry if he drops it, but otherwise I prefer a slim, sleek, understated black case that slides easily in and out of my pocket.

I have gone through several cases for the iphone 4s and very few seem to make it longer then 6 months. I haven't  had the otterbox for much longer then two weeks and i have found several upsides and maybe a downside or two:The Good:This thing seems very sturdy. Sturdy enough that I believe you could throw it and the phone wouldn't even notice it.It has a nice non-slip bottom and well covered portsIt fits the phone very nicely without being bothersome to take off if need beThe price is great on amazon, you can't beat $22The Bad:This case is like a tank. its huge and cumbersome and weighs a lot.When you buy an iphone you want to show off its beautiful gorilla glass front and back but the screens crack so easily that you a forced to use a tank of a case if you have kids, but if feels like the weight is more then double the iphone when on.The port covers can be rather annoying at times and slightly finicky to get closed.The rubber on the back and sides is too grippy. The phone is hard to get out of my pocket.Overview:All in all this really is a nice strong sturdy case with a view minor flaws and a little extra weight. worth the $22 but not worth the $40 you might pay in a store.

284,1127763,AP13MPKF4L3YS,B005SUHPO6,ak317,"[1, 1]","Before I start this review, I need to make it clear, this specific Otterbox product is especially made for the iPhone 4S model, the other one sold here on Amazon is made the the iPhone 4 (NOT 4S).  The one for the 4S has a bigger hole for the main camera, and instead of three holes for the earpiece section (for the 4), it's now one large hole (for the 4S).  Make sure you know what you are purchasing!**This specific Otterbox is COMPATIBLE with the Sprint iPhone 4S.**Since I just purchased a new iPhone 4S, I needed a case, but my expectations are high, it needs to include a holster and hold it very securely.  The one I initially bought at the Sprint Store was terrible as the clip securing my phone to the holster was weak and an easy tap of the finger would quickly pop it out.I looked around online and I see all the rave reviews about the Otterbox Defender for the 4S.  After watching their product demo videos, I was convinced and returned the junky holster for the Otterbox Defender.From watching the videos on how to assemble it, I got the idea of how to put it together.  It comes in three main parts, the plastic inner shell, the silicone outer shell, and the holster.  When you open the box, you remove the holster from the silicone, remove the silicone from the inner shell, and lastly separate the inner shell to clip in your iPhone.  Then do it in reverse, insert the iphone, snap together the inner shell, attach the silicone over the inner shell, and clip it into the holster.  Assembly time: about five minutes if you never tried it before.Some of the cool quirks I liked is:No need for a do it yourself screen shield.  The inner shell includes a built in screen shield and it works well, no bubbles!The holster clip can also be used as a kickstand so you can watch movies on a table or counter.The holster can hold the iPhone with the screen inside or outside; perfect for protecting it with the screen inside, and can be placed outside so you can use the built in kickstand.The holster's belt clip is a ""J"" shape, therefore it won't fall off your belt if you pull up without opening the clip first.The holes made the for the camera does not affect picture quality.Since the exterior is silicone, it grips well and gives it a comfortable feel.Dislikes:It's bulky and adds weight.  But that's the sacrifice you make when you want protection.You'll hate this if you have a dock product like a 3rd party speaker dock system.  The inner & outer protective layers makes it impossible to dock it so you can recharge the phone and/or play music.  However, you can still use Apple's USB/ipod cable or a third party iPod connector like iGo iTips, that will fit fine.The holster clip release is awkward as the product releases from the left/right of the iPod, not from the top or bottom.It's not waterproof, so don't do anything dumb to void your warranty.Overall, I enjoy this product.  For the extra cost, you don't need a $15 to $30 screen protector that you might likely goof up on installing, and you know once you install it that you have well rounded protection for your iPhone.  I can't give it five stars because they haven't found a way to make it compatible with this nice new JBL iPod/phone dock I got for the holidays.",4.0,No need for a screen protector!  But you'll not like it if you have a dock.,1325462400,"01 2, 2012"

I'm updating this because I've had the case for about 5 mos. now and it's not as great as I thought it would be, which is why I've dropped from 5 stars to 4. The protection lives up to its reputation because I have dropped it many times and my phone is not damaged in any way. There are 2 parts to this case- the inner, hard plastic then the outer, rubber covering. Well, the hard plastic case is fine, it's the rubber one that hasn't lasted. The port covers immediately started breaking and eventually falling off, which made the rubber loose and annoying and then more pieces falling off since it was so loose. My previous case was also an Otterbox and it also had the same issue but didn't start falling apart until many months later... maybe a year...? With this new case it lasted much less longer. Turns out others I know, with the exact same case, color and all, is also in the same bad shape. What a disappointment. I'm currently looking for another case and in the meantime still using this Otterbox.Wasn't expecting much change from this Otterbox for the iPhone 4s compared to the last one I had, which was the just 1 previous version before for the iPhone 4. But I like this one so much more! The outer rubber case has a much tighter fit and makes the phone a tiny bit smaller & sleeker than the last case did. It just seems less bulky. Also, the tighter fit is is especially nice in all the port flaps that now have a nice, tight close! It also has a better feel for me in it's texture compared to the last one-- it feels more substantial- don't know why!? My phone has already been dropped at least twice and my phone is fine- just what I expected with the Otterbox protection. One last comment: love the color! No surprises when I got it- not much difference from what's shown on Amazon- you know how tricky color on a computer can be, but no surprises here and I would definitely recommend this case to anyone!

He didn't think anything of it until his phone rang and then slowly realized his phone was shattered into a million pieces. Since then it has also lost big chunks of the flexible rubber.On the other hand, I bought my first otterbox four year ago at an AT&T; store. After two years a bloodhound tore it apart but my phone magically was untouched. I called the company and they replaced it for free. I have had the second one for two years now and the only downside is the flexible rubber outside has ripped on a corner.We called the company about my husbands phone case. They refused to pay for the cost to fix his screen. They only offered to send us a new case which my husband declined because it obviously was not effective to begin with. If he took the case off to replace it with a new one all the glass on his screen would simply fall off anyways.So basically his phone case was a complete fail. If your phone actually gets damaged while in the case they will not do anything about it and if that's the case why both? Get something less bulky and prettier.

What bothered me most was how many business calls I had taken and lost because people didn't want to listen to that echo. So I went to the apple store and talked to the tech support staff. The person I spoke to explained that if apple doesn't sell it in their stores, then it's not compatible with the device. He pointed out that they don't sell the LifeProof ones. He offered me the OtterBox Defender at almost double the price that I paid for here at Amazon.

Shasta, year round, and my iPhone needs protection from snow in the Winter, and from trail-dust the rest of the year. In addition, I wanted a case that offered some protection for the screen, should I drop it on something hard. This is the only case I've found that offers serious screen protection. Overall I'm happy with it - the hard case with the screen protection is surrounded by a rubbery cushion that's easy to grip securely. It does bulk up the dimensions of the phone a bit, but I don't see any way around that. It's a trade-off I'm willing to make to get the extra screen protection.As others have noted, there's no way you can insert the phone in a dock when the case is on. And while I've removed the case every so often, mostly to clean the rubber part that can get grimy after many days on dusty trails, it takes enough time that you won't want to do if daily. And even if it didn't take so much time, it does stretch the rubber each time I do that so that it doesn't fit quite as tightly after several such stretching. So I wouldn't advise removing the phone from the case daily just to insert it into a dock. I did get one the (way more expensive than it should be!) dock extenders, but it raises the phone high enough in the dock to make me worried about torquing the connector in the dock enough to break it. So I just connect the phone through the device's mini-plug input...The flaps that protect the headphone jack and the 'silence' switch at the upper left side of the phone still close securely after many openings to access those functions. BUT - this is my biggest complaint - the flap at the bottom of the case that's supposed to protect the charging connector has NEVER worked well. I think I got it to actually close tightly maybe 4 times total - and it took several minutes of fussing with it each time, so I never bothered after that. Eventually the flap developed a tear from repeated flexing in my pocket, so I cut it off, and ordered some of those (REALLY ridiculously overpriced!) silicone plugs for the dock connector. Of course since they're so small, it's easy to lose them. It would be much better if Otterbox could fix the currently-useless dock protector problem - then it would deserve the extra star!",4.0,"Overall I'm happy with it, but it needs some improvements",1350518400,"10 18, 2012"

I've dropped my phone loads of times and it's still perfectly intact. However, there seems to be a perpetual problem with the silicone outer layer. When I first got the case, I had only had it maybe two months before the outer layer became so stretched out that it did not fit the phone properly. You couldn't even close the ports because they didn't fit into the grooves anymore. This has happened to everyone I know who has owned one of these cases. The good news is that the company is awesome. You call up, tell them the problem, and they send you a new one. No questions asked. My new outer layer lasted much longer than the first. It's starting to deform now, but I think it's been a year since I bought it. I noticed that Amazon sells the silicone layers for these cases separately.

I drop my phone regularly and there is no damage whatsoever to the case or the phone itself. The only reason that I didn't give it a full 5 starts is due to the fact that this case is a pain in the butt to get in and out of pants pockets. Yes, it does come with a belt clip...but honestly, I hate belt clips. The material that it is made out of has a great non-slide surface, but that also aids in the difficulty with the pockets. Its also very bulky so you can't really use it with iPhone docks. The other reason I did not get it a 5 out of 5 is because of the cover tabs. There are tabs that cover the headphone jack, the silence slider and the charging port. Since I charge my phone every night, and sometimes in the day, the sides of the tabs (which hold it into place) have worn off so that it doesn't stay fully closed. This is also starting to happen to the headphone jack tab and the silence slide tab. But after so many months, these are the only two things that are wrong with it.

That's why i got it.- The screen cover is a thin layer of plastic that when sitting on top of the iphone creates a 'film' illusion where if you have good vision you will see a hazy layer.  I think it's because there is a small space between the case's layer of plastic and the iphone's face that bends the light.  Its quite annoying to me. I would prefer no plastic at all on the screen front and use a stick on clear protector over the iphone face.-  The headphone jack is closed by a plastic piece that lifts up but it's annoying to have to fiddle with it to put in headphones.-  The case is fairly bulky and the plastic flap on the bottom of the case will prevent you from EVER using this in an ipod dock if the case is on.- The case takes a couple minutes at least to remove and it's annoying to do if you would be doing it more than once a month or so.- The case is very bad in moist environments, worse than no case at all because moisture gets trapped under the plastic film on top of the iphone screen and you will see a ""spread out water droplet effect.""  I learned this after I worked out with the phone and noticed the effect.This case is ideal for dry sandy environments where dropping the phone on the hard surface is a possibility, I still recommend it if you can get over the negatives.",3.0,I wish there was something a little better,1323129600,"12 6, 2011"

3079,1130558,AZH76SEVPRUNN,B005SUHPO6,CCorns,"[0, 0]","As this is my first iPhone and my first Otterbox case, I wanted the best protection I could get from a well-known brand. Obviously, if you are buying the Otterbox, your first thought is phone protection, then probably features, and lastly looks.The Otterbox Defender feels solid (with or without an iPhone). It has a hard plastic cover that encases my iPhone 4S, with the silicone gel placed on the outside. I liked the gel on the outside as it makes cushion for impact (compared to the reverse design). The case comes with screen protect built-in, so the screen's chances of getting damaged are lessened (which I favor for ""resell"" value later down the road).For me personally, I really wanted something slim and protective, but I noticed the Otterbox isn't overly bulky. Think of a total of 2 iPhone 4S put together and that will be your total thickness of the Otterbox. I do feel as if my iPhone 4S gained some weight though, so that is a slight disadvantage. This may require a bluetooth or use of speakerphone rather than the old-fashioned hand-to-ear method (for prolonged periods of time). The port covers are quiet nice and are easy to snap back into place when done using; even the buttons are easier to press than I thought.There is only one major quirk in this design and I will explain my experience in as much detail as I can muster. As I mentioned earlier, it comes with a screen protector built in the Otterbox Defender case. The screen itself is not ""matted"", but it does reduce some glare. It feels smooth and easy to use (almost more so than the iPhone 4S screen). Also, due to the screen protector design, it ""feels"" like it doesn't get as much fingerprints or smudges (its easy to wipe off, which is nice). On the other hand, with the beautiful Retina display, it doesn't feel perfectly crisp. By perfect, I mean literally...perfect. It will be most noticeable on text (rather than pictures or video). There is one other small thing, I play games quiet a bit on my iPhone and felt that the screen protector contributed to a slight sensitivity decrease on touching the iPhone screen. It is definitely not major, but every once in a while, it wouldn't register a full finger stroke or movement.Overall, I love the case and I know it will serve it's purpose well and my main goal as protection with looks being secondary.

The watermark problem that the 3GS has under the screen has been solved with this 4s model.This case does not seem bulky, it is flat and comfortable when texting or surfing the net.The volume controls work well. The flap for the mute/sound switch is bigger than the 3Gs otterbox and allows you to easily switch the sound off.There are 2 layers of protection . First the phone is encased in plastic and the second is the silicone layer your place on top of that.It has a built in screen protector that works well. The outside of it can be easily cleaned.This is the only case I have had that has protected my phone from drops. Every other case I had before did not protect my phone from cracking.Cons:There is a design flaw with the flap that covers the charging jack on the bottom of the phone. It does not close unless you manipulate it to death. This is bad because I am constantly charging my phone and then the flap will not close, leaving the bottom open and vulnerable to damage etc..Also, as you use this case, the rubber becomes stretched out. this leaves the outside of the case not fitting right.

The case fits the phone very well and it gives the phone a much more solid feel in my hand than was the case with the bare phone.There is one annoyance with the case however.  This is not a waterproof/dust proof case.  It wasn't meant to be.  So why did they put covers over the headphone jack, the charging jack, and the silent switch?  Having to open these covers, especially the silent switch and the charging jack, is a bother that could have been avoided if they'd just left those open.  The charging jack cover especially tends to open with very little effort, often while just taking the phone out of the holster.Speaking of the holster, while it is pretty sturdy, I found out yesterday that it doesn't always hold the phone quite as securely as I'd hoped.  Just turning in my seat was enough, apparently, to dislodge the phone from the holster.  Luckily, the phone only dropped to the seat, but if I was not sitting down, it would have been a test of how well the case protects the phone, something I really don't care to test.  I'll be replacing the holster with a different type of belt case in the next couple of days because of this issue.Overall, I would recommend this case for someone who is concerned about breaking their iPhone.

Furthermore, the silicon part of the case has ""flaps"" that can be opened or closed (hence the almost waterproof feel of the case).

Other cases that claimed to do what this OtterBox does just didn't pass muster and I've had a phone prior to this one break (and I've had a number of /cases/ break, as well). I'm not exactly kind to my electronics. I'm clumsy and occasionally forgetful. I stopped counting how many times I dropped the iPhone 4S by the second day I owned it.Thanks to a friend's recommendation, however, I ordered this OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case and it arrived before I got the phone. The included holster is nice but unnecessary for me, though I'm sure other consumers appreciate it. The built-in screen protector is great. It's important to add that it even works if you've already got a screen protector in place. Construction of the case with the cushioned plastic casing overlaid with durable rubber gives you the best of both worlds: a hardshell case with a comfortable feel. The volume, power, and home buttons are easily recognizable in the rubber and easily utilized; I've never had a problem with using the buttons through this case because the OtterBox folks really paid attention to the importance of functionality. All in all, a good utilitarian design.I will say that while the secured flap of rubber that protects where you connect the charging cable was a really smart idea, the similar coverings for the headphone jack and especially the ringer switch might border on excessive. I turn the ringer on my phone on and off several times a day, each time having to pull back the flap to flip the switch. It's such a minor inconvenience, though, on an otherwise exquisite product. The other thing that I find pointless is the clear circle on the back of the case that allows everyone to see the Apple logo. I would've been fine with it being one solid sheet with only the opening for the camera. It makes me wonder if Apple urged the company to keep their logo visible or whether consumers requested that design element. Like my previous complaint, however, it's such a minor thing that it's easily overlooked. What matters to me is that my phone crashes to the floor time and again... and time and again, remains unharmed.

It's comfortable, durable, but I'm disappointed having paid so much more for it for the color because it doesn't look like the picture. It's a lot lighter which shows a lot of contrast between the black of the phone and the case. If you had a white phone, I think it would look really cool, but with a black phone it doesn't look as good as the picture shows.EDITED:In addition to what I explained in the comments section, after having tried the white phone with this case and posting the photos;  I'm noticing that the manufacturer's picture is not a true representation of what the face looks like on any of these cases. Keep in mind when buying any of them that the color of the phone will show as a border around the screen. IOW, the picture shows the color of the case going all the way to the screen. But it doesn't.In reality, the case shows a border of the phone color. So if you have a black one it looks like it's part of the screen. If you have a white one, when it's on, you see the color of the plastic case, then a white border, then a small black border, then the screen. It's too bad. The white would be a really pretty color with this teal color but, imo,  it just becomes too busy with that border on it.So, no matter what case you get, take that into consideration. With a black case and a black phone, it all looks like one piece. With any other color faceplate, you will see the phone color itself. So, I'd imagine with a white phone, you might consider the grey case with the white faceplate.  Long story short, if I had it to do over again, I'd pick my case first, then decide on which phone color I wanted.All of that said, these cases are awesome cases. They're really comfortable and durable, they just don't have the refinement down for the color scheme for people who notice the little things. My husband's black phone, black case looks awesome.

However, this case paid for itself more than 4 times over yesterday when I accidentally dropped my phone on a piece of concrete (ironically surrounded by grass) while getting in my car.  It bounced once before landing in the grass.  If I had not spent that $25 plus shipping I would have had to call my wireless provider to ask for a new phone, which would have had me shelling out a deductible of over $100 dollars before they would ship my new phone.  This case is definitely worth the price plus shipping.  When I picked up the phone, the case barely had a scratch on it and the scratch looked like something that resulted from normal wear and tear.  This case seems extremely durable but just in case I have another mishap in which it becomes too damaged to use I am definitely going to buy another one just to have on hand.  The only problem I had with the case is that it is very difficult to unlock to put the phone inside.  However, once the phone is in there, that difficulty unlocking it could be a good thing because that means that if you drop your phone like I did, the case won't quickly come apart, ejecting your phone thereby defeating the purpose of the case.Update 8/29/2012This case is great the only complaint I have the silicone cover does not fit a snugly as it use to and I haven't had the case for more than 3 months yet.",4.0,Worth the Price,1343952000,"08 3, 2012"

If you don't pop your phone in juuuuust right, 30 seconds after you let go, the phone falls out and onto the floor. Also, the rim of the rubber section can slide into the clip part and, again, 30 seconds after you let go, the phone falls out and onto the floor. I'm clumsy.

Getting this in the mail at 3:30 pm after only waiting 3 days since I ordered it was a big plus but now onto the case packaging. It came in a yellow package casing with a holographic seal on the top, signifying  it was not a knock-off. The case by otterbox comes with a comforting paper with instructions to follow to put on the case. BUT NOW FINALLY THE CASE and holster. The case, whatever color, has a soft exterior for absorption with a grip backing. Despite being a very hard case, it is surprisingly sleek and thin. The coloring is very pure, even though I got grey and white, you can trust that getting any color would look like an actual color and not an offshade lacking fullness. The interior hard plastic is unwavering and holds firmly. It has a ready, protective plastic that goes over the phone but I don't mind at the slightest. For a few pesky buyers, note that there is a very acute delay to the pressing of the screen and the action preformed due to the plastic time, but the time should not delay you from playing whatever app you want to the fullest capability!

It feels secure, which is exactly what I need for taking my phone out in the field.  On looks alone, maybe a 2.

The case nearly doubles the thickness of the phone and also keeps me from using any of the docking solutions I have.  The rubber on the case has a good feel, but it is tough to get it into and out of my pockets.  The microphone is surrounded by thick rubber, and I do see a noticeable degradation on microphone performance unless I lift up the headphone flap to clear some of the rubber away.  The rubber flap covering the iPhone connector stubbornly refuse to stay closed, so it's always flapping around.  On the positive side, the screen protector works great for me.  No loss of sensitivity.  All of the buttons work very well with little extra effort required to make them work.  Overall, recommended if you really need this much protection.

I also do not like the open camera port or open earpiece port as this allows dust in and it works its way down behind the screen protector. I am a little bit picky so that is the only negative comments I have on the Otterbox defender case because it does offer excellent protection to the iphone.

I thought I was getting a sweet deal by getting a normally $50 Otterbox for ~$15.  But in hind site, that was pretty foolish.I received my purchase in the usual two days being a prime customer.  The case came in Otterbox packaging, but not the high speed kind you see nowadays on the shelf at BB or TGT.  The case was just loose in the box with no internal packaging.  The case just flopped around in the box.  That sent up a red flag immediately.  Upon immediate inspection the individual components were not tightly put together as one would expect with a new item and the plastic screen protector was already visibly damaged along the seem.  Its not as if I was sent a previously returned item, but one that was used for a while, damaged, and then returned.  I can't say for sure if this was a knockoff of an Otterbox or just a damaged one.  The Otterbox logo was there, but it just felt cheap and not what you'd expect from Otterbox.  After returning this one immediately, I purchased this item from BB and I must say the one I currently possess right away just felt more substantial.I read alot of reviews (positive and negative) and took a chance to try and save some money thinking Amazon wouldn't want to tarnish its good reputation and allow its customers to purchase garbage or knockoffs.  Don't get me wrong...I love Amazon.  But this one slipped by the Quality Control department.  Think about it...Everywhere else (I mean everywhere) sells the Otterbox Defender for $49.99 and I've never seen them on sale, but here they are for under $20 bucks?!?!  Most likely your getting seconds with manufacturing defects, damaged returned items, or a knockoff.  If so Amazon should state that, not just ""Retail Packaging.""  It did come in retail packaging as stated, but come on...a polished turd is still a turd.Don't let this turn you off from the Otterbox Defender though.

He is constantly ruining cell phones - he's gone through 7 in the past 2 1/2 to 3 years. He is constantly dropping his cell, stuffing it in his pockets, which may be fine for some, but he has tools in a tool belt that constantly slam into his pockets. Someone bought a Defender to work and the threw it on the floor and actually drove a forklift over it - and there was NO damage to the cell phone OR the Defender. That was all I had to see to prove this cell phone protector really works well.  Although my husband is carefull with his cell, the environment he works in isn't always the best for a cell phone. But he has to have it for work so I got the Defender. It is a little bulkier then most, but who cares- it does its job. He uses the case it came with to put his phone in and wears it on his belt. The one and only issue he had in the beginning was it does turn the volume off so he had to turn the phone around to keep the volume buttons for being touched. Problem solved easily and he is extremely happy - and THAT is all that matters to me. He has had it for 2 mmonths now and we live in hot, very humid Texas and he's had no issues with humidity or water problems. Not any dust issues, and working at Home Depot provides TONS of dust! Nothing is destruction proof - you just have to care for your cell. Except that now maybe we won't be buying a cell phone for him every 6 or 7 months!

I bought some screen protectors which someone recommended would prevent the oily residue from pooling. Not. The oily pools took up about 1/3 of the screen. So I bought some baby powder and gave a couple of light poofs (facing the iPhone screen down and the baby powder up with a quick squeeze). That seems to have done the trick. Finally. Kind of a pain, I mistakenly thought I'd be putting the case on the phone and that would be the end of that. It didn't work out that way.Also what is up with the headphone jack?

I ended up fitting a ""stick-on"" screen & back protector on to try and overcome this, & to most intents & purposes this did solve it, but I also did this to offer some protection to the exposed areas that the cut-outs on the case for the front camera & rear camera do not protect because they do not have a built in film, like the screen cut-out has. Otterbox had recommended removing any screen protectors already applied because they may hinder the operation of the touchscreen.

The otterbox itself offers great protection for the phone.  It's a hard plastic case with a silicone/rubber type of cover that protects the phone from shock.And you are going to need that shockproofing if you use the belt holster that comes with the defender series Otterbox.  My belt holster just wasn't designed as well as the otterbox itself.  After the 5th ""drop out of the holster"" fall to the floor, I decided I couldn't take anymore chances with the Otterbox belt holster.Problems with the holster are: you have to make sure that the phone is clicked EXACTLY into place in the holster.  If you are off just even a smidge on placement, the phone will ride in the holster for awhile, and then fall out onto the floor.  The second issue is that the clip on the holster that holds it to your belt is a plastic/composite that seems to break rather easily if you stress it at all.  I have 2 friends that have broken theirs off of their belts when sitting down into chairs with armrests on them.  The armrests will wrench the holster away from the belt clip...and you are back to a useless piece of plastic in your hand.If you don't need a belt holster, the defender series otter is a good way to go.  However, if you carry the phone on your belt, you'll need to figure something else out.I gave up on the otterbox and bought a LifeProof case instead.

You'll also see that I recognized but forgave features that in time disappointed me.  Today I also hold the opinion that the the outer material of the 4 and 4S Defender are made of the same gummy material.New review:I  feel that buying it was a mistake. It's big, heavy, and ""sticky,"" with an outer case made of a substance like gum rubber. As you may have learned,it's hard to get the Defender out of a pocket. If you're standing up you can tug it out of a front pocket with only moderate difficulty, usually before the incoming call goes to VM. A lot of jeans, shorts and casual pants now include a phone pocket. You likely won't get a Defender into one of those pockets, but if you do, it won't come out, absent heroic effort. Worst is when you have the Defender in your right front pocket while driving seat-belted. When the phone rings you have to unbuckle your seat belt, turn your weight onto your left buttock, and worm the Defender out of your pocket without hitting a kid on a bike (I'm on the line between lean and skinny; larger people would have more problems). The Defender is an ad for a Bluetooth connection in your car audio so you can avoid the contortions. The Defender's soft outer case is flabby, meaning, as others point out, you are constantly shoving the little hatch covers and fastener pieces back into place because it's so easy for them to slip.  Worst, my iPhone, wearing a Defender, did a face-plant onto  gravel. Bye-bye screen, and the Defender's hard inner frame broke. If I'd worn the belt holster it would have prevented that destruction so long as I didn't mind looking like an 80s geek, and the holster seems to double the bulk of the package, which I decided was too big without the holster.  Sorry, Otter. I award a 1.A few words about the Otterbox Commuter., which I bought after the Defender broke. The Commuter improves on the Defender by fitting the new phone pockets on jeans, shorts, and casual trousers and by sliding in and out of all pockets pretty easily. The Commuter is compact while wrapping the phone nicely with a hard plastic inner frame and a softer outer cover. I believed the size-protection ratio was pretty good.  But, as with the Defender, the case's flap that snugs over the iPhone's data/power port wore out quickly, and I cut it off when it started dangling. I also carved out some of the soft cover around the earphone socket because the original opening did not accommodate large and L-shaped  plugs. I thought the Commuter gave pretty good protection, although mine broke when I dropped the phone a couple days ago. At least the phone is undamaged. I'm shopping now for a new non-Otter case.  I really tried to give the Commuter three stars, but I couldn't go over two.My original review:When I got my iPhone 4S, friends convinced me to get an Otterbox Defender. Good advice. To save money, I ordered the Defender for the iPhone 4, whose price had dropped when the newer model came out.  Don't do that. The 4's outer skin is thicker (to me, at least) than the 4S's, fits loosely and is so ""gummy"" in texture that removing the phone clad in the Defender 4 from your pocket is a struggle.The Defender 4S provides a snug fit, feels a little more compact, and has a ""harder"" finish. It does not glide from your pocket, which is good when you think about it, but there is no struggle. The outer skin of the Defender 4S has a sort of herringbone pattern of tiny raised diamonds, which distinguishes it from the Defender 4. Zoom the product photo and you'll see.I like the way the Otterbox Defender adds bulk to the iPhone 4S. I don't have huge hands, but the bare iPhone 4S is so thin and slick that I drop it unless I am very careful. To me the Defender 4S provides perfect grip. Perfect. Not too large. Not too small. Not too slick. Not too sticky. Just right.The holster is a problem. It provides great protection, but it's too bulky and the swivel clasp does not keep the phone stable on my belt (do not read that to mean the holster does not stay put) and close to my body, so the phone gets in the way of my arm while walking, moving, or sitting. I almost never use the holster. If you regularly carry your phone in a bag, pouch, or purse that provides a little protection, you can find Defenders for sale without the holster at a small discount.If Otterbox could do *something* to make the holster more user-friendly, I'd give its Defender for iPhone 4S five stars instead of four. I give the Defender for iPhone 4 three stars because of the loose-fitting, gummy outer layer and the holster.To end on a positive note, my iPhone 4S has hit pavement, rocks, grass, dirt, carpets, tile, slate, and other hard surfaces and has suffered zero damage while clad either in the Defender 4 or the Defender 4S. I like them both and highly recommend the Otterbox Defender for iPhone 4S.",1.0,First I liked it a lot. Now I don't like it at all.,1362268800,"03 3, 2013"

I've probably replaced the rubber about 4 times in 3 years, and I don't abuse my phone by any means -- there are just flaws in the design that inevitably rip and tear.

It's very easy to hold onto, no worries about it slipping out of your hand. It's not dainty, but I don't mind the way it looks either, and the grey/yellow combination is nice. The hard yellow case is sturdy and snaps on tightly and easily. It has padding on the interior to protect the back of the phone.I like that the protective screens are integral to the case. No messing around with film.

It didn't take much to do it either. It's a snug fitting case, so it takes a little stretching to get it on, but this silicone doesn't have much stretch to it. The part that ripped was a thin little piece between the ring silencer and the volume buttons. If the silicone is this brittle, I would expect that opening and closing the various flaps would quickly result in those tearing off as well.What a shame, because otherwise I love this case.Although I am returning this case, I may well buy another one as strange as that may seem. I just can't seem to find another case I like as well as this one. I think if I make sure to stretch the thicker parts (rather than the more delicate thin parts) when I put the cover on I should be able to avoid tearing it. I don't intend to take the case of on a regular basis, otherwise this would definitely be a bad choice. I also don't intend to open and close the flaps on a frequent basis, so I think I may be able to avoid ripping these - and if I do, I would probably just cut them off. many cases come without coverings for all of the ports anyway.",3.0,The Silicone Ripped!,1323129600,"12 6, 2011"

My iphone has no scratches anywhere, and I have never had a cracked screen. It works as well as it did the day I bought it, and I have dropped it quite a few times. My only complaint is that I would love it if it were easier to purchase replacement screen protectors for the case separately. The screen in the case takes all the damage from drops and just day to day use that the phone normally would, so it has a few scratches. However, I did a little research, and apparently Otterbox's customer service is top notch and will send a replacement screen with no questions asked. I just wish the process was a bit easier. Additionally, I had to purchase a charger adapter to extend the charging port on my ipod speakers-- they are a few years old and were built before iphone cases were a thing. However, given the crazy protection this case offers, I think that a few bucks for an extender is worth it. Now, I just wish Otterbox made a jogging case that I could use without removing the Defender.

After a couple yrs the rubber outter case part started to tear from me opening and closing it so much to mute/unmute my phone. This Otterbox was a lightning deal so I decided to get it. I really like the design and how it protects my iPhone. I love the built in screen cover on Otterbox cases too.Why am I rating a 3? I would rate 3 & 1/2 if I could. The only reason it's not higher is because the back isn't textured like my old Otterbox, instead it's smooth so harder to keep a grasp on. I use the elliptical everyday and to pass the time I play games on my phone, so not being able to have a good grasp makes it a lot more difficult. Also, when I go running I use the app on my phone to check miles, pace, time, etc so having a good grasp is important while I'm running. Then at the gym when I do strength training I always have my phone to record sets/reps and how many lbs and I usually set my phone on my leg when I do exercises like a chest press, leg press, etc... My old Otterbox case stayed there but this one will keep sliding off.Other than that, I have no complaints. If that's not a big issue for you, then I'd definitely recommend.

This is the third defender case for iPhone that I have owned - which is why it received 4 stars instead of 5. I bought my original one which lasted a bit over 1 year before the flap for the mute switch broke, the screen cover got too scratched to see and the bottom flap wouldn't close. I thought that wasn't quite a long enough life span IMHO. The nice thing is that Otterbox customer service is the best out there. I called, took pictures of the damage and they sent me a new one for free. Then that one lasted about a year and the same problems occurred. This time I bought a new one simply because I wanted something other than black because I have a tendency to misplace my phone in the car/bed/backpack/purse and black tends to blend in with other things making it difficult to find. (BTW - if you can buy the case in the color you want on Amazon - that is what I recommend as it is so much cheaper. I really wanted the Broncos color one but just couldn't dish out the extra money to buy it from the Otterbox store).Pros:-I drop my phone frequently enough to worry me enough to put a case on it. This case has routinely protected my phone from back pocket falls (so far!)-No-slip grip surface is something I love (helps me drop it even less often)-Ports make all the necessary items accessible (except the main USB port on many speaker sets - which is the case with most cases out there)-built in screen protector-Color was as depicted (although you must allow for some deviation due to individual monitors and their settings)Cons:-Not really for moist and humid environments as the condensation gets trapped between the phone and the hard case-Not for sandy environments (took it to the beach with me on vacation and did my best to keep it away from the sand but, like sand does for so many things, it got in there despite my best efforts)-You can't connect to a lot of speakers without an extender-It does seem to fall apart in around a year (with the outer rubber part stretching out too much first. If you are taking the case on and off (one or two times a week even) to plug it in and if you are constantly muting and un muting the phone throughout the day (like I have to do) and therefore using that flap frequently, it will definitely wear out and stretch out within a year. However, I have friends who have owned theirs for two years or more and still working great (so maybe I am just a ""rough user"") GOOD NEWS: Call up otterbox, within the year, say it fell apart due to normal usage (which is true) and they send you a new one (just the part that broke - so not the hard case if that is fine).End result: I have absolutely zero reason to buy anything else.",4.0,Love Otterbox!,1353888000,"11 26, 2012"

It sits up a bit on some parts of the screen and you can actually feel it move downward and upward as you touch it or slide your fingers across it. 2) the spot at the top where the headphone jack plugs in is offset. It does not allow the headphone to plug in at all, instead the hole is actually over the tiny screw that goes in at the top of the phone, so you have to open the cover to plug in your headphones.

Drop it, pick it up, keep it movin. Screen is completely covered, so I don't worry about if keys are in my pocket with my phone or anything. Your phone is not getting a single scratch on it with this case. Only parts exposed to air are the loud speaker and mic at the bottom, the mic on top, the camera in the back and the camera and speaker at front top. And all exposed parts are recessed in the case so very low chance of anything ever touching them. Put this case on a brand new phone and it will look like a brand new phone two years later when you upgrade. And now with Gazelle and other mobile phone buying companies you will be able to get more money for your phone from them.Ascetics: 10/10Looks and feels great. I'm a man so I like a little bulk to my phones and this adds it. Doesn't add much weight tho. I actually wish it was a little heavier.Price: 10/10Picked this up when it was 14 bucks... no contest. Go to the mall or a mobile phone store and you will see this case for at least $50. Highest price I saw was from Sprint for $60. No brainer. Oh and by the way if you did spend $60 bucks on this case it was still well worth it.ConsThe clip for this case is good and doubles as a stand for the phone. Cool. But if you have the phone clipped to your belt you have to be careful to make sure you dont lock the clip in the open stand position when you are removing and putting the phone on the clip. I've done this countless times and when the clip is locked open it will fall off your belt easily. The good news though, is that when your phone hits the ground you aren't worried that it got damaged at all.It takes a hot second to remove your phone from the case. A good 2 minutes. But I guess thats just the price to have it protected so well.The case lets dirt and dust in thru the open recesses I talk about earlier. They should have just added a soft rubber seal around the open areas to solve this issue. So you have to clean it out every few days or so. Not a big deal but since it takes so long to remove it and put it back in the case... Its a noticeable annoyance. Definitely not a deal breaker tho.Do yourself a favor, when you get this case, just look at the youtube video on how to instal your phone. You will save yourself 10 mins of figuring it out on your own. lolTwo last things... If they added a external battery/qwerty keyboard option to this case... it would be the grand-daddy god of all phone cases ever.

Well, I got what I paid for.Design:I've had this case on my phone for 3 months now and the rubber part of the casing has stretched.Mind you, the rubber casing is a rather large part of the entire case. It comprises the face and covers all the various plug-ins with little rubber latches. Well, at this point, some of the latches (the one that covers the important port where I insert the charger, for instance) has loosened to the point that it does not stay closed. So, my phone essentially has a tail now, made of sticky rubber that grabs onto everything in my pocket or bag. And that port is constantly open.The rubber corners of the phone have also stretched, and once a day or so I'll have to re-organize the damn case so that it fits on my phone.HOWEVERMy father ordered the exact same case and he has had a somewhat different experience. His case immediately fit much snugger and therefore feels a bit more secure. Although, he complains about the latches for the ports coming open as well. So despite the looseness of the rubber, those little latches tend to free themselves no matter what (HIGHLY ANNOYING)Security:I have dropped my phone several times (always on carpet though) and this case has seemingly protected it from serious damage. The hard plastic feels secure and although the rubber is loose I don't think the case would come apart if I were to drop my phone on concrete.Conclusion: Meh.",3.0,Rubber latches to cover ports don't work/fit of case varies,1347926400,"09 18, 2012"

If this same case, which is sold at the ATT store for 49.99, is the same quality as the one I received then I got an awesome deal. If it is not, then I got what I paid for. I compared this case to my old Otterbox one that I currently have on my 3gs. I thought the construction would be about the same, and I was wrong. Reading thru the reviews before had I realized that maybe some people were just being over picky about the issues that they were having. I figured I would be able to live with them. I can and will live with them, but I just want you the reader to fully understand them. Again not trying to compare it to a whole other product, but the outside case is no where close to the the material and feel of the 3gs case. Its a lot more softer, and not quit as shock absorbing as I would like. I will take care of my phone but if I ever do drop it, I fear that the material will not just hold out. Another issue is the fact of the material staying on the hard case itself. When you have to plug in the phone charger the bottom flap pulls the outer case material from the hard case itself. And when you are done charging and go to replace the little flap its a bit of a pain to get it back in side. I am to the point where I am thinking about just cutting it off to keep from having the issue. But I don't want to have the connector pins exposed. I have gone as far as super gluing the outer case to the hard case, to keep it from shifting each and every time I have to take it out of my pocket.

Many times we worry that we are paying too low of a price and the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" is always in the back of our minds.  However, I owned an Otterbox that fit the Blackberry Storm and felt it protected that phone well.  When I moved on to the I Phone4S; I knew I needed the Otterbox that fit this style. Now the only thing needed was to acquire it for the best price possible.  Of course I read review after review until I felt comfortable with the seller at Amazon.  The product and process was exactly as described.  It shipped and was able to be tracked along the way.  When I received and opened it, it was exactly as described.  I have used it daily both with the clip on belt attachment and free in my pocket.  Like all I phone cases...this one limits the opening for your ear bud jack.  The apple one's fit without opening the flap, through the hole provided.  However, universal car jacks and other style speaker jacks require the flap to be open and then some may still not ""seat"" properly enough to get a good connection.  Minor issue and what you save in the purchase of the Otterbox can be placed on ordering a smaller connection jack. The other minor irritation is that the bottom flap used to close off the power source connector doesn't stay in place extremely well.  However, I have not found a flap that does on any other hybrid case.  I have seen many people simply cut it off and live without that area being covered. Of course, I have dropped the phone by accident, and the case protects the phone well. Just like the name say's it's an Ottebox Defender!

The one I got for my friend wasn't, even though it had the sticker for authenticity on the box, which is a holographic sticker on the lid of the box. I know what the real thing looks like because I bought one for myself for $50 from the Sprint store and it had the sticker on the box. But that isn't enough to prove that it is authentic. When my iphone 4S case got stretched and had a little crack, I called Otter Box for a replacement. I had heard there was a 1 year warranty for the 4/4S cases (btw with the redesign, I don't think the same is true for the 5 case). They asked me to look for shapes (like 2 rectangles and an oval) that were imprinted into the silicone on the inside. There were some numbers in the oval on the right. I read the woman the 4 digits and passed the test of authenticity. (Those shapes are also on the inside of the plastic shell at the top). Bottom line, the case that I ordered here doesn't have those shapes. The silicone also feels different - kind of mushy. Now it is cracked and my friend can't call Otter Box.On a separate note, Otter Box has redesigned the iphone 4S and 5 defender cases so that they don't stretch anymore. The silicone of the new 4S case that Otter Box sent me is a lot tougher and the iphone 5 defender case that I got for my mom and friend is even tougher.

He proceeded to ensure me that they would send me another case. GREAT I was relieved, now I can protected my broken phone properly with a ""better working case"". They said they would always replaced a broken product.So moral of the story if your case too is defective and your phone breaks they will for sure at no cost replace your case but the phone is your fault because you used their product.CHEERS!",1.0,awful product,1361145600,"02 18, 2013"

(Clumsy me has dropped the phone several times, after this protection was placed on the phone, with no harm having been done.)  The trade-off is the loss of the pure beauty of the phone itself, but my clumsiness made that decision easy.Installing the hybrid case was not difficult.  Just a matter of following directions and the video for the product.A couple of spots that are frequently needed to be ""opened"" for attachment of cable or microphone/earphones tend to stay open, when it would be nice if they closed securely, when not needed to be opened.  But that is not a big problem.The big problem is with the Holster (belt clip/stand).  It opens easily and then closes back up easily, provided that it is not fully opened.  If fully opened, it is necessary to pull on a tab to get it to close.  The tab is NOT easy to pull (release).  Eventually--within a matter of weeks--this caused the clip to snap into two pieces, making the holster useless.  I don't really need this to use as a stand, so the only loss is using it as a belt clip.

You must put your phone in a hard plastic case, and then cover it with another rubbery plastic case.  There is a built in screen protector.  Now, this is not a speedy process- it will take you about a minute to get in on or off.  In my opinion it is worth it.  This case provides protection for the not so responsible.  Most phones are pretty pricey, and this case will give you piece of mind.  It will protect against dropping and banging.  It is not waterproof, and I suppose if you ran over your phone you'd be out of luck.  But short of intense abuse, this case protects against everything.  The screen cover does not distort picture or touchscreen use.  One thing many people complain about is how big it makes your phone.  This is true.  It really probably makes your phone twice as big.  I carry a purse and it still fits in my back pocket, so to me it is worth it.  I am on my second otterbox, because after a while the outer case stretched out and looked a bit rough.

She is the most accident prone person I've ever met, and when she got an iPhone I knew it would have been broken in a week without this case.  Her phone has been fine for almost 4 months now.The good:First, installing the case was easy, people who have issues really make me wonder.  The case fitment is absolutely perfect, it couldn't be any better.  The phone sits in there snug, and is protected from all angles.  The fact that the screen now has a lip and isn't flush give it additional protection as well.  The color of the case looks nice as well, I wouldn't carry it being a guy, but it looks very nice.Now for the bad:The soft outer skin should have been made out of a different material.  In less than four months, the rubber where the charging port is that you have to lift to charge has cracked and had to be cut off.  The exact same thing happened to the silence switch.  I have the Otterbox Commuter case and I haven't had this problem myself.  Without these pieces, the case has become less protective, and has somewhat lost its shape making it look really bad.  I find this unacceptable in a case that retails for $50 on Otterbox's website.Also, this case is VERY bulky, but that also contributes to its ability to protect its contents.  It is a trade off, and you have to decide if you are okay with that or not.

After reading reviews for the Otterbox I decided to order one and I couldn't be happier.  Unlike some other people, I don't find it bulky at all.  I actually prefer the more substantial feel of the phone and find it much more comfortable to use.  The built in screen saver is fabulous; you don't even know it's there.

The case was relatively simply to put together just follow the picture instructions if you have problems. The headphone jack has a cover over it so dust/dirt don't get in it which i really like, it's large enough to fit basically any headphone in. Calling still sounded as crystal clear as when my phone had no case on it at all.My only gripe about the product is the screen protector built into the case, when it's taken out of the packaging the screen protector has a weird layering on it. When the full case is on and you touch the screen, the protector ""attach's"" to the real screen on your phone creating the perception as if the phone is oil-y/greasy.I though't it'd be gone in a few days but it got worse as time went on. I researched online and found out that if you take a bottle of baby powder, hold it about 2 feet away from the inside of the screen protector, give it a light squeeze so that a very fine cloud of powder gently touches the protector. After applying the powder the screen protector was flawless, it was as if there were no protector to begin with.Anyways, the case was an absolute steal at $16.99. Yes it does add some bulk to the phone but i don't mind it seeing how whenever i drop the phone i won't be worried.

So, once you put it on, your best bet is just to keep it on for as long as you can. If the case does't allow your phone to fit into a dock (see below), you can't just simply take the case off in a jiffy.3) It does not fit into my dock and from what I've uncovered after I purchased the case (go figure). In fact, I don't think it will fit into any dock. Now I have to either purchase an extender if I want to dock it.

The USB cord works just fine with it.All in all I like the case; however I would not pay $50+tax for it. I don't really care about the bulk. If you plan to put the phone in your pocket, this is not the case for you, the rubber part does not allow the phone to easily slip in or out of anything.

It protects almost every part of the phone and keeps it safe against almost any kind of a drop. The back of the case is rubberized, and is comfortable to hold in the hand. However here are some cons:-Really bulky; At least doubles the size of the original iPhone.-Massive and complicated; When I say this I mean that it is big, once again, and it has three pieces that work together for protection, but are a little hard to get used to. When I first got the case it took me five minutes to get it off, and about three to get it on, every single day and night. Once you learn how they fit together it is pretty easy.-WILL NOT dock; I knew this going in, but it is still a little irritating. My dock is my main charger, and I use it almost every single night. So every night, and every morning respectively, I have to take the case of the phone and then put it back on. You can still use any other kind of charger, and you can still use the headphone jack on the top with most cords or headphones.-Makes it harder to take out of the pocket; I find it harder, especially because it is a little bulkier, to take in and out of my pocket.Overall this is an awesome case. It fits well on my iPhone and I never have to worry about it either. Recommended to anyone who wants a non-water resistant case. As I said before, it is very protective.

It simply makes the music to me pointless in this case as I enjoy listening to my playlists from my phone.

In terms of protection, this is a wonderful case and has saved my phone SEVERAL times. The color options were great. I bought the pink/grey for myself, and the black/grey for my husband. I also liked the cover for the headphone jack to keeps dust out. This comes in handy since the IPhone has a sensor in it, that if blocked by dust, WILL cause problems. (Q-Tip and rubbing alcohol are a fix).The only problems I have with this case is that it will not fit my Iphone/Ipod radio docking station and the outer fit has become loose because I have had to remove it a few times for regular cleaning and the docking station.This case is made for protection, and in that aspect it earns a full 5 stars. But the protection comes at a price. It's two layers (one hard, and one soft)that add a considerable girth to the phone. You will notice the difference and it will not nicely sit in your back pocket of some jeans (if you a female). Not being able to use my docking station (Sony ZS-S2ip CD-RW Playback) is a big issue for me since I have music on most of the time.I have completely removed my case over the past couple of months(6-10 times for cleaning and to use the docking station), and now the rubber section around the screen and over the home button is loose. I have a time trying to keep the rubber over the home button secure. I don't think it will last much longer and I will probably look into getting something else.All-in-all, this is the best product if you do not plan on taking the cover off more than once or twice and if you do not have a docking station like mine.

After a lot of on line research, I settled on the Otterbox Defender series. I've not been disappointed. I watched the Otterbox instruction video which made it easy to figure out how to put the case on the phone. The inner soft cover fits the phone perfectly, and the hard outer shell adds a level of protection and security. The knobby rubber texture makes it easy to hold onto.  I like the built in screen protecter. It doesn't interfere with the touch screen at all.  In fact, for the most part, the case does not interfere with phone operation at all. The flap over the charging outlet can be a bit awkward because it needs a little extra attention to open and close securely.  The only downside to the case is the detachable plastic carrier. While it holds the phone securely, it's too big and bulky for me. I can't clip it to a belt or pocket and only use it when I drop my phone in my purse. Snapping the phone into the carrier with the touch screen to the inside helps keep the screen protector from picking up scratches and dust and protects the volume controls from getting bumped.

I read reviews that mentioned issues regarding the flap that opens and closes over the hole for ear phones. Many think the opening on the flap is incorrectly placed. let me explain very carefully. If you hold the phone in your hand and look at the top (with screen facing your body) you will see an opening for earbuds.  now look closer to the immediate right and you will see a tiny pinhole next to it.  The flap (when closed) is meant to cover and protect the ear bud hole.  The opening in the flap is to keep the tiny pinhole OPEN and EXPOSED!!!  The pinhole has something to do with operations of the phone...so it must always be exposed.  So this is NOT a flaw...it is supposed to be that way!

That being said, the OtterBox Defender Series case is the perfect case to protect an iPhone 4/4s. I have accidentally dropped my iPhone 4s far too many times, yet it has taken no damage. I've dropped it out of my hand, accidentally thrown it across a room onto a hardwood floor when attempting to catch it, and I've even dropped it off of my (over 6-feet tall) bunk bed onto my dorm's hardwood floor. I've gotten to the point that I don't even flinch if my phone slips out of my hand onto tile/wood/concrete, etc. The worst damage that has been dealt has been to the case itself, and that is only a chip here and there from major drops. These things are extremely strong, but should your OtterBox break, you can actually contact the company and, after verifying the damage with pictures, they will send you a new OtterBox free of charge! This company is truly committed to providing a protective case and great service for a reasonable price.

I charge my phone nightly and the plastic flap is already completely ragged.Another issue I have is that in order to place my phone on speakers, I have to take it out of the case completely. I have an iPod, but if I want to listen to Pandora through my phone via speakers, I'm outta luck unless I want to take apart the case.Finally, the pretty blue cover gets dingy and dirty quickly.

It's bulky, no denying that, but it's does it's job which is too protect my phone. One thing that bugs me though is that I bought this case for when I babysit, little kids love smart phones but tend to drop them a lot, and the design in the rubber on the back side has a diamond pattern on it. Things like play dough get stuck in the pattern and are a pain to get out. Another problem is the built in screen protector, no oil slick, but when it gets even a small scratch it ruins the illusion that its clear. The port protectors are a plus, but it can be annoying t o have a piece of rubber sticking out when you are using headphones. I only recommend this case if you are willing so sacrifice slimness for protection.UPDATE-My case has bit the dust after months of usage.

Both are decent cases and each have a few pros and cons, but for my purposes, the otterbox is superior. Let me first go over the Griffin so I can make a few distinctions.Griffin:Pros* sturdy. I bought it because I read a review from a guy in the military that said he dropped it from his helicopter and the phone wasn't damaged. I believe it. I've dropped and flung my phone multiple times with the Griffin and there wasn't even a scratch.* touch screen is just as good with the case as it is without itCons* It's huge. It's big and bulky and feels like a brick to carry around.* There is a flap that covers the camera lens. In order to take a picture, you have to fold the flap over and it never stays. You pretty much better plan on never taking pictures or pictures that don't have a portion of your finger in the picture with the Griffin.* The flaps that cover the headphone jack and volume lever both broke off. Only had it 6 months and both flaps broke off.* Voice control button - there's a bump over the voice control button that constantly causes it to be pressed when it's in your pocket. At least daily it happens and sometimes causes it to dial people randomly or play music. Horrible, horrible design.OtterboxCons* a bit less sturdy than the griffin, although I've dropped it once and it protected it fine, but you certainly couldn't throw it around like the Griffin* The screen cover causes the screen to be a little less sensitive than no screen or the GriffinPros* WAAAAAAY smaller than the Griffin. The griffin was like a brick and the otterbox is at least reasonable in size* Open area for the back camera lens. Might not seem like a big deal, but trust me, when you're trying to get a quick picture that you may miss, it makes a huge difference.* Better rubber. I can't see the flaps breaking off on this phone. The buttons are easier to push and the voice control button isn't elevated so you don't randomly hold down the voice control. The bottom fap for the plug is also easier to open than the GriffinSummaryBoth cases are well made, but unless I'm in combat or plan on throwing it off the second floor of my house every week, I can't see a reason anyone would want the Griffin instead. It's bulky and not super convenient for every day use, although it will certainly protect your phone. After I cracked the screen of my phone and it ran me $165 to fix, I figure I wanted the most protection available. I was wrong, there comes a point where ultimate protection makes takes away from the use of the phone. The Otterbox offers a happy medium. It protects the phone, isn't huge and still allows you to utilize the functionality of the phone.

After a few moments I figured it out and was surprised how easy it really is.  It goes on or off in about 30 seconds, once you get the hang of it.  The best news is it did, and continues to do, its main purpose of protecting my iphone if it somehow falls.  Well, it happend.  I had my iphone tucked away in the OtterBox faced inward on the holster.  It was hooked to my jeans' waist cuz I didn't have a belt on.  I needed to carry a large box, full of junk, out the front.  I carried the box to the door and put it down to open the door.  As I picked it back up the edge of the box just lifted the holster off my jeans. The whole thing dropped to the floor, which is hard marble tiles. I heard the crash and knew it was my iphone. I put the box back down and picked up the holster which still had the iphone securely held. I expected the worse when I pulled the iphone off the holster and took a look at the screen. Nothing!! Not a mark or knick or anything else. The screen was still perfect.  The Otterbox had paid for itself at that point. From now on, however, I'll not hook the holster to beltless pants. I'll put it in my pocket, next time.I see they're still on sale. A good product that does its job. I definitly recommend it.",5.0,Saved my Iphone 4s,1333152000,"03 31, 2012"

14528,1142007,A1C5KBV1DF8NHP,B005SUHPO6,Randal A. Harp,"[98, 109]","I know this is a lot of review but I didn't feel like it's a review until you know the particulars. Sorry, but I can't do that in 40 words or less. A review is supposed to help prospective buyers make a smarter decision. Seeing a review like ""It's cool. I like it. Buy it."" doesn't help me at all.As an Apple and Macintosh support tech, the styling of all their products (winners and the losers) has impressed me since the beginning. That became part of the problem as I looked for the right case. After seeing so many iPhones with shattered glass screens in my work, I knew when I upgraded my old 3G iPhone for the new 4s, protection was going to be my #1 priority. At least I thought it was.Once I had placed my order for the iPhone, what did I do? I went straight to Amazon and let my emotions drive me to go with style first. I couldn't help it. I mean hey...the iPhone 4s is just sexy and I wanted it seen. I ordered 2 cases since the total for both of them was less than $25:CaseCrown Apple iPhone 4 and 4S Exo Polycarbonate Slim Fit Case - Red/Black (Fits AT&T;, Sprint and Verizon iPhone 4 and 4S)and theAcase(TM) iPhone 4 and 4S Superleggera PRO Dual Layer Protection (Red/Black) case (Fits AT&T;, Sprint and Verizon iPhone 4 and 4S).CaseCrown makes some great products. I've owned a number of their cases and holsters for my phones over the years but while their case fit perfectly and looked really cool with the black and red, I didn't believe it had enough protection. Off it came and I went with the other one I bought.The Acase brought better protection to the phone because it had rubber covers over the connector, earphone plug and the silence button. Although the back covered up the Apple on back the finish on the case was excellent. It was slightly tacky and felt good to hold with little fear of it slipping out of your hand and it went into my jeans pocket easily. It also stayed put on the seat while I was driving. Even though I knew I would eventually get a holster and belt clip I thought my search was over. I was perfectly happy until...At a customer's site the next morning, one of the guys there showed me his 2-week old iPhone 4s - working perfectly except for the horribly shattered glass screen. As soon as I got home that day I went back online to get my phone some major protection. To heck with styling, I wanted armor and that came down to 2 choices; the Griffin Survivor and the Otterbox Defender. After reading the reviews until my eyes went blurry, I pulled the trigger on the Griffin. If you haven't seen the video on their site showing how they tried to destroy a case and phone, you should. I knew it was bulky but I wanted to know that when I dropped my phone, I could simply pick it up and continue using it with no damage.The Griffin came in before noon the next day and I immediately put my iPhone into it. Bulky, yes. Safe from water spray, snow, mud, dirt, and clumsy exits from my truck...yes. Therefore, I believe at this time, there is no better case than the Griffin Survivor if you want to know your iPhone is safe. However, it is not even close to being stylish!Within a couple of hours of working with this on my belt, I made the decision to get back to my office so I could order the Otterbox Defender. I got it shipped to me the next day using my Prime advantage (yeah Amazon).As soon as I got it in and carefully installed my iPhone into it, I knew the Defender was what I wanted.Abridged version: Want to show off most of the styling of the iPhone? Go with Acase, CaseCrown, or any of the pretty cases. Want hard core protection? Get the Griffin Survivor. Want some of both? Get the Otterbox Defender.===============================Update: 5/16/2012 - I'm back where I started on my search for a good balance of protection and styling. The Otterbox I bought in January 2012 has let me down in two ways. The first was the dust and particles getting under the protective screen. (Note: I do computer tech support and photography so it's not like I'm in a hostile environment like a construction site every day.) I did my best to keep all the ports closed and secure but within days of taking it apart and cleaning it regularly, the trash showed up under that screen cover.The other problem I had is the silicone cover itself. After removing the cover for cleaning less than 4 times, the silicone lost it's original shape. My iPhone didn't shrink or loose weight so it has to be the cover. The bottom connector port cover gets the most use and won't stay closed at all and the loose fit on my phone looks like crap. I'm very disappointed about this and because of the time that has passed since I purchased it, it cannot be returned. I will let the manufacturer know what has happened and hope they will find a fix for future products. As for now though, I'm not the only one...there are other reviews with the same issue. I'm kicking my rating down to 2 stars.",2.0,"Styling, Protection Or A Bit Of Both for your iPhone (see update)",1325894400,"01 7, 2012"

With Verizon, and probably most other providers, water ingestion is the one hazard against which there is no protection at all in my contract: the phone must be replaced at my expense at then-current, full price.  Also, the iPhone has quite a number of obviously vulnerable areas of screen on the outside.  While Verizon gives an allowance if you bring in a banged-up example and ask to trade it in, I decided the risk was just too high.The Otterbox was rated favorably and I saw it at a reasonable price, about half of list so I ordered it.  It arrived in very quick time, like 2 days after my order, an amazing performance, and once I figured out how to open it and put the iPhone inside, I was convinced that the latter was safe against being dropped onto concrete from at least chest high.  It might provide some protection from splashing, but it is not waterproof, so it wouldn't have saved my former smartphone from taking a wade in a swimming pool.  Its belt holster isn't perfect; although it holds it firmly, it's exactly at the center of gravity so gives the impression that the phone could tip over while in the holster.  However, it is doubtful if that would cause it to release.  I am wearing it horizontally, while the former smartphone worked better vertically.While I would have liked a waterproof case I decided it wasn't practical for a device that needs recharging every day, which the iPhone does; also, waterproof cases would certainly be even larger and heavier (the Otterbox adds maybe 20% to the phone's dimensions and weight).  All controls work with the phone protected in the case.The most serious criticism I have is the totally inadequate instructions packaged with the case.

While I did use a more streamlined case, Otterbox is superior.  I'm just grateful I went through only one case before ordering this one!As other reviewers pointed out, the Defender has two cases, an inner polycarbonate one and an outer silicone one.  While the box in which I received my Otterbox had diagrams showing how to separate the two cases, I watched a video and was able to separate the two cases and install my iPhone into the hard case within seconds.  The polycarbonate case has a thin, clear shield to eliminate the need for a screensaver. Be sure to wipe your iPhone screen and the Otterbox clear shield with a soft cloth before inserting the phone into the hard case.  I used one of those small microfiber cloths I use to clean my glasses.  The shield on the polycarbonate case is a strong selling point for me, as there's always been at least one little bubble I didn't get out of my screensaver in the past. The silicone case goes on over the hard case, and it requires a bit of care to fit the material over the area for the phone's buttons.There is no interference with any of the iPhone's functions from Otterbox Defender.  Photos aren't changed at all because there's no blockage of the camera lens by the case.This is my second Otterbox; I used one a couple of years ago on another cellphone.  That case protected my cellphone from coffee, rain, dust, and all the everyday hazards to which cellphones are subjected.  I'm expecting the same service from this case.  The Defender model is much more slender than my earlier one.  While the phone slots in a couple of my older handbags may be a little too narrow for this case, it fits perfectly into  the holders in my everyday bag, my briefcase, and my carryon.

The belt clip was great, and I liked how it can become a tabletop stand for the phone.The meh:Among the many reviews I read before purchasing the Otter Box, were several mentions concerning mystery scratches created on the iPhone glass screen while using the case. I have to say, I did also experience this. They are very faint etchings, just as pictured in some of the reviews, in the lower part of the phone, on the extreme left and right sides of the glass. I am guessing that they probably have a chance to occur from the case whenever the phone is dropped. And I'm a bit clumsy sometimes; I know I dropped my phone at least four times while in the case.I finally decided to stop using the Otter Box not because of the small screen glass scratches (in a part of the phone that isn't really all that important), but because I simply wanted to return to the small form factor of the having the iPhone 4s in a slip-on case that I could more easily hold in my hands and pocket.",4.0,Great protection and belt storage / Large form factor and faint glass scratching,1374796800,"07 26, 2013"

Do I wish they were less bulky? of course, however, I want to protect the phone more than fussing over aesthetics.Last year's otterbox had seen its better days long ago. the &#34;rubber&#34; outer casing began to stretch and lose it's memory do it had gaps and tendencies to pull away form the inner hard case. the flaps to contain charging port etc had torn off months ago (I tend to slip the phone into my pocket instead of the plastic belt case) and I had to resort to snaking my finger up under the rubber to access the home button. It was time to replace. After searching around, I opted for the security of the defender series because I have kids and we are active and I don't want to pay insurance deductibles on iphones.

A little harder, perhaps it will hold its shape longer. The back has a smoother plastic feel to it.

It's rugged, but not a durable as I expected it to be.  The silicone portion of the case began to show wear pretty quickly, and after about 6 months, parts of the silicone were beginning to wear away; the portion that covered the headphone &#34;jack&#34; actually tore away and then the flap that covered where the charger would be inserted tore away.So, the overall quality of the product was quite disappointing as it just didn't hold up as long as I expected it to for the price I paid.I also found that the case made the phone very bulky to the point that it wouldn't fit in the slots that are often sewn into the interiors of purses or briefcase or backpacks for phones.  I think a slimmer profile of a case could be designed for just as much protection.  Thus, my choice to go with a Lifeproof (TM)  Case when the silicone portion of my otterbox case finally wore away so much that it wasn't worth keeping.",3.0,Not as Durable As Hoped For,1384819200,"11 19, 2013"

Women may not like this as much...it seems like it would be harder to fit in your purse or a pocket if you needed to. We also like the thicker, built in screen protector.

The iPhone bulks up a bit with this on, quite noticeably if you carry it in your pocket.  The belt clip is bulky plastic, awkward, uncomfortable (poke-ey), and altogether not worth it; I've used sleeker holsters before, and this one is destined to stay in some junk drawer until its ultimate demise.  If you use an iPhone dock (for playing music, charging, etc.) you will probably need a dock extender, because the case gets in the way.

Once you put your iPhone 4s inside you KNOW it's perfectly safe.First set up takes about 5 minutes. After you figure it out it only takes 30 seconds to disassemble or reassemble.With previous cases I've owned dust, sand, and other things get into the phone through all the openings. This case deals with it in the perfect way: It leaves the microphone, speaker, noise cancellation port, cameras, and flash unaffected while putting an easy to lift rubber cover over the Charger port, headphone port, silence switch, volume buttons, and sleep button. The flash works well with this case so far while many cases are too close and ruin photos with a flash.It even has a built in protective cover for the screen.It adds minimal bulk, and while it isn't the smallest amount of bulk, I feel better with an extra 1mm of protection (when compared to most other cases) for my $500 device!!! The iPhone 4s fits in my case perfectly tight and secure.Now my phone feels like it could get run over by a truck and still work!The belt clip also works very well as a stand for the iPhone which comes in handy when I set it on my piano or desk.Actually, I have two complaints.  First, the protector makes navigating the phone just a tad more different and difficult. Hardly a problem, but worth mentioning so you don't freak out at first. The second issue is that a few of my audio adapters don't fit through the case to get to the iPhone. This doesn't effect any of my normal headsets, but I have some adapters that split the audio out into RCA outputs so I can plug into other audio devices. A simple fix is to take a sharpie, mark how much room you need for the adapter to fit, and use a dremel to notch out a bit more space. Took me 5 minutes and now everything fits perfectly. I took off a star for this design flaw even though it's fixable since it's a bit of a pain and oversight on their part IMO.Even with the minor complaints I'd still give it 4.5 out of 5 stars and consider the best protective case on the market for the iPhone 4s.

With a little bit of pressure from above (like resting your arm against the phone case, wearing a seat belt, or even the vibration of the phone ringing), this can cause the volume to go down.

I've already seen this phone and case go flying across concrete and hardwood floors...without a scratch to the case or phone.-New rubber composition that still offers nonskid without getting stuck in your pockets.-Built-in screen protector, so you don't have to purchase one in addition.-Price!  Back when I bought my Otterbox for my first iPhone, they were still in that $50-$60 dollar range, but now you can pick up an original for $20 on Amazon.Cons:-The dock connector cover still does not like to fit...where everything else does.  I've noticed this on several Otterbox Defender cases I've owned and purchased.  It may not be a huge deal breaker, but as much as I and my family use our phones outside, it'd be nice to have a good seal.-The color.  Granted this Defender WASN'T for me, I still don't know about the pink on plum color scheme...but that's just me personally.Hogan's Wrap-Up:Overall, I have to give this latest Otterbox 5 out of 5.  The dock connector cover is a bit of an issue to me, but then again it's only been used for about a week, and may form to the rest of the case.  Everything else is true to Otterbox and their Defender series: perfect protection for all aspects of life!",5.0,Otterbox does it again!,1344211200,"08 6, 2012"

Bought my first a year ago when I purchased my iPhone...Heard they were the tops when it comes to keeping your phone safe and I was well informed. I've destroyed countless phones by buying cheap plastic cases that do nothing but change the phones appearance.I have dropped my phone plenty of times over the last year, enough to say confidently had I not had this case my screen would be damaged to say the least.At first glance it does bulk up your iPhone quite a bit... unless you purchase some sort of adapter it wont sit on a dock while it's in the case. Even so, it looks great! very smooth design, access to all the phones ports, light sensors, mics, speaker, and doesn't interfere with cameras. I have seen other comparable cases designed for rugged protection that make the phone look tacky and are easily double the size of otterboxes.I love the rubber 'skin' on the outside, keeps it from being slid off tables, won't fall out of your pocket, and gives some grip when propping your phone up to use facetime or the flashlight app.The only time I ever take the case off the phone is when it is on my stereo dock at home, which totally pays off... my phone looks exactly the way it did when I first pulled it out of it's packaging. Both the front and back glass is immaculate, no scratches, no scuffs, nothing. Having the built in screen protector is definitely a benefit you don't find in many other cases.After over a year of constant use, the case finally started to show wear. I sat on a leather couch with my phone in my back pocket and tore a piece of the silicon outer layer... still got two months out of it after that until a part of the plastic housing cracked somehow. and even now my old case is still completely functional in protecting my device... just decided that it was time to get a new color and change it up a bit.All that being said, these cases are the best bang for your buck...

Leave the container sit on the counter or table, Give the container a slight squeeze (blowing invisible powder into the air and onto the screen).

It was a really good cover, but some of my biggest complaints about it was that it picked up pocket lint, the silicone wasn't very tight, and the phone sensor would sometimes not respond.... I just got this updated Otterbox for the 4s and put it on my regular iPhone 4 (White; Verizon) and it fits perfectly! The sensor/ear piece has been fixed so there are no more sensor issues and much easier to clean, the silicone/rubber is updated and much less sticky (it's like a whole different compound/feel)! The rubber is much tighter as well! I haven't used it very much yet, but so far it's a very good upgrade from the already great Defender Otterbox. I can verify that it works perfectly with the White iPhone 4 (not just the 4s) from Verizon. I would recommend this to everyone looking for really good protection for your phone and anyone looking to upgrade from the original otterbox series for iPhone 4.The Yellow/Grey is actually really good looking too.

But I read lots of positive ones too, so I decided to chance it. Here's my experience compared to some bad reviews:-  The case arrived in mint condition, in the original retail packaging as promised.-  I checked for the OtterBox logo placements.  The logo is where it's supposed to be, and clearly marked.-  The inside edge of the camera hole is black to prevent a glare when taking pictures.  One reviewer received a fake case and had to color the hole in with a black permanent marker.  Yikes.- The silicone did not warp or crack around the edges when I fit it over the inner polycarbonate shell (be careful not to over-stretch it.)  You have to work a bit at tucking the seal around the faceplate, or it will leave a gap.  If you take care when securing it, the silicone shouldn't be damaged.-  The charging port is accessible.  You just have to lift the protective flap to expose it.  Unlike one complaint, you do not have to remove your phone from the case every time you charge it.-  The headphone hole is not covered up, and the flap is in the right place.  Like the charging port, there's a protective flap that you have to lift to expose it.-  The screen is very sharp and clear underneath the screen protector.  It's not dull or difficult to read.-  Yes, the Defender is bulkier than the fashion cases that offer little, if any, protection.  While this case is thick, it is not THAT bulky.  It's very comfortable, and I don't feel like the phone is going to slip out of my hand.As for the bad reviews...I'm sure OtterBox has released some defective cases.  Even the best brands produce lemons. I also suspect some problems were caused by user error or fake cases.I'm very glad I decided to buy this case.  It's attractive and sturdy, and the price was much lower than on the Otterbox website or at my cell phone provider's store.  I buy from a listing that says it's ""Sold by amazon"" whenever possible.

Those other 2 cost about a third more, and yet I like this Otterbox Defender the best.  Here's why: 1) The phone seems better protected, 2) nice texture, 3) small size (when not using clip), 4) many options.  Any case is going to make phone bulkier, but the Otterbox styles keep that to a minimum.  By contrast, the Griffin has a larger and bumpy exterior and the surface grips to things a little too much, which is why I moved on from that one.  I then purchased the Otterbox UBC but after 8 months the hard plastic at the bottom broke off (where the power cord plugs in).  The plastic flap at the location also never fit well.  That's why I got the defender, and the design seems much better.  It doesn't seem like it will have opportunity to break in the same way, and the flaps definitely seem to fit better.

17366,1144845,A2YXTTJ0IXT2AY,B005SUHPO6,Thai,"[6, 26]","I just got this Otterbox for my Iphone 4s (Sprint). It is what you have seen...a very well made product. Otterbox makes high quality stuff. And yes, i did get the updated design with the big camera cutout. Everyone can tell you the goods about the Otterbox. I am not here to repeat those things. I am here to tell you about ONE MAJOR FLAW:The problem is that when you put your iphone into the holster, you better be sure that NOTHING is caught in it. In other words, if your shirt tail is in between the holster and the Iphone, then the iphone is NOT clipped in!! It may feel like it is clipped in, but as soon as you turn and your shirt pulls out (of the holster), your Iphone goes flying out! This happened while i was walking and i heard my iphone dropped to the ground. The case itself protected my Iphone well. I was lucky...not because the case protected my Iphone, BUT because i heard it fall! If i was in a busy building, then i would have lost my Iphone because i would not be able to hear my iphone dropping to the ground.The only way around this is to conciously use one hand to lift your shirt up and use the other hand to clip the Iphone into the holster. Two hand method. Forget rapid holstering of your Iphone with this Otterbox!! Now, if you tuck your shirt in, then this may not be a problem. However, you better be sure that the tucked shirt is nicely tucked in or else part of the shirt can be caught in between the holster and the case...and you have the flying Iphone syndrome all over again!Other minor negatives:- The screen protector does dull the beautiful retina screen a bit, but functionality remains excellent. This was expected and i did not mind at all.- Bulky...when i sit in my car and strap my seatbelt in, i can feel the holster/case pressing against my side hip bone...maybe a comfort issue on long drives.- It is kinda hard to clip the case onto the holster, unless you slide it in perfect. Just a little to the left or right and you will not be able to clip it in.So, i think that the product is very well made. The new rubber surround is very high quality. But, the flying Iphone issue has made me look for other alternatives.
